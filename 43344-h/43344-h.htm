<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Don Hale with the Flying Squadron” is
the third of the “Don Hale Stories.” It follows
“Don Hale in the War Zone,” and
“Don Hale Over There,” and tells what happens
to Don after he relinquishes his
dangerous post as an ambulance driver for
the Red Cross on the western front.</p>

<p>But Don’s new duties are of a far more
dangerous nature; and during his training in
the aviation school and after he finally becomes
a full-fledged member of that most
famous of all flying squadrons, the Lafayette
Escadrille, he has interesting experiences and
enough exciting adventures to last even the
most spirited youngster an entire lifetime.</p>

<p>It may be safely said, however, that the account
is not overdrawn; indeed, in the air
service, in which most valiant deeds have
been performed, it would be hard to exaggerate
the perils which beset the “cavalry of the
clouds” on every side.</p>

<p>To add to the interest of Don’s experiences
with the escadrille there is a certain mystery
connected with several characters which is
not solved until the end of the story.</p>

<p>In the next book of the series, “Don Hale
with the Yanks,” is told the further adventures
of the young combat pilot after he has
been transferred to the American air service.
He sees much of that memorable conflict—one
of the turning points of the great war—when,
at Chateau Thierry, the German drive
for Paris was halted by the victorious Americans.</p>

<h1 id='chI'>CHAPTER I—THE GREENHORN</h1>

<p>A rickety-looking cab, containing two
passengers and much luggage, and driven by
a gray-haired <span class='it'>cocher</span>, drew slowly up to a high
iron gate and came to a halt. And the wheels
had scarcely stopped before two young chaps,
with exclamations of deep satisfaction and relief,
literally tumbled out of the ancient vehicle
and stared about them.</p>

<p>“Well, Don, here we are at last!” cried the
elder.</p>

<p>“Yes, George. And this is certainly one
of the greatest moments of my life. Tomorrow
I start my training to become a
pilot,” exclaimed the other, such a degree of
enthusiasm expressed in his tone as to make
the wrinkled cab driver turn, survey him with
a curious grin, and comment in the French
tongue:</p>

<p>“I guess that’s the way most of them act
until something happens.”</p>

<p>But the boys scarcely heard him.</p>

<p>Surmounting the iron gate, inside of which
an armed sentry was slowly pacing, this inscription
in large, bold letters, stood out
against the sky:</p>

<p>“<span class='sc'>École d’Aviation Militaire de Beaumont</span>.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope the Boches won’t get
you, young monsieur,” continued the driver.
“But, if you don’t mind, I’d be glad if you’d
will your life insurance to me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll think about it,” laughed the boy.
He deposited several pieces of silver in the
palm of the hand held toward him, then began
the task of getting his luggage off the
vehicle. By the time this was done the
sentry had opened the great iron gate.</p>

<p>With a hasty good-bye, the boys turned
toward the soldier and producing several
important-looking papers handed them to
him.</p>

<p>And while the proceeding was underway
this series of comments passed between five
young men, attired in the horizon blue uniform
of the French poilu, who were strolling
inside the great enclosure not far away:</p>

<p>“Well, well! What have we here?”</p>

<p>“No doubt a couple more pilots.”</p>

<p>“But, if I’m not mistaken, one of them is
actually wearing the stars and wings insignia
of the air service on his uniform. He’s a
corporal.”</p>

<p>“So he is! Such a young chap, too!—looks,
for all the world, like a high-school boy on his
way home from the place of demerit marks
and ciphers.”</p>

<p>“Let’s give ’em the grand quiz.”</p>

<p>It took the sentry only an instant to scan
the papers and nod his head in approval, and
another instant for the newcomers to gather
up their possessions and head for the group
of five.</p>

<p>“Step up and give your names, boys.”
The speaker was a tall, angular youth with
bushy red hair and twinkling blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Don Hale,” answered one of the newcomers.</p>

<p>“George Glenn,” replied the other.</p>

<p>“Of the Lafayette Squadron?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! And on a couple of days’ furlough.”</p>

<p>And one of the natural but not very agreeable
ways of the world was exemplified then
and there; for Don Hale, the prospective
student of the great military flying school,
immediately found his presence totally ignored,
while his companion, member of the
most famous escadrille of the aviation service,
began to receive the homage and admiration
due to one who had attained such an exalted
position in life. To be a member of the
Lafayette Flying Corps was indeed a signal
honor—an honor coveted above all things
by the majority of the American aviation
students.</p>

<p>Don Hale, smiling a little to himself, thereupon
seized the opportunity to examine the
view outspread before him.</p>

<p>And what the boy saw made him draw a
deep, long breath, like one who has just experienced
a feeling of vast satisfaction and
pleasure. It was an immense level field, or
rather a series of fields. Far in the distance
long rows of low canvas hangars and tents
stood out in faint gray tones against the background
of earth and sky. Nearer at hand
were lines of rather dingy-looking wooden
structures—the barracks—and isolated buildings
used for various purposes, while dominating
all rose a tall and graceful wireless mast.</p>

<p>Far more interesting to the American lad,
however, was the sight of several airplanes
performing evolutions in the distant sky.
The sun had descended in the west and its
cheerful rays no longer touched the earth, but
every now and again one or another of the
graceful flying machines caught the glow,
and, as if touched by a fairy’s wand, became
transformed for the moment into a flashing
object of silver and gold.</p>

<p>Don Hale felt his pulse quicken. How
wonderful it was to be up in the heavens,
soaring with all the ease, the grace, the certainty
of a huge bird of the air! It made him
long for the time to come when he, too, would
have his ambition fulfilled! Presently a deep
gruff voice broke in upon his meditations.</p>

<p>“Better come down to earth, son.”</p>

<p>The red-headed chap had spoken.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” laughed the new student.
“What’s that, sir—my last job, you ask? Oh,
driving a Red Cross ambulance near the Verdun
front.”</p>

<p>“I must say we seem to have met a couple
of real heroes,” chuckled the other. “And
now, to show you that I haven’t forgotten my
Fifth Avenue manners, I’ll introduce these
would-be flyers, most of whom as yet haven’t
risen above the grasshopper stage of the
game.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, with many chuckles, he presented
Gene Shannon, Cal Cummings, Ben
Holt and Roy Mittengale, adding that his own
name was Tom Dorsey.</p>

<p>“Glad to know you all!” declared Don
Hale, heartily.</p>

<p>“So am I,” exclaimed George.</p>

<p>“Very gratifying indeed, I’m sure!”
laughed Dorsey. “We all hope that later on
some people about whom we are hearing a
whole lot won’t be so glad to meet us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you coming aces!” grinned Ben
Holt.</p>

<p>“Hooray, hooray, for the future cannon-flying
express!” chuckled Mittengale. Then,
turning toward Don, he said: “I suppose
that the day you didn’t run into at least a
half dozen or so hair-breadth escapes must
have seemed like a pretty dull one?”</p>

<p>“I had all the close calls I wanted,” confessed
the former ambulance driver.</p>

<p>“And yet you are now going in for something
which at times ought to make that Red
Cross work look like little rides of joy. Ever
take a spin in a plane?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boy! There’s some job ahead of you,
then.” Mittengale laughed. “You’ll have to
get right down to business.”</p>

<p>“You can just better believe I will!” declared
Don, enthusiastically. “I’m mighty
anxious for the time to arrive when I can go
up to business.”</p>

<p>“It may never come,” suggested Ben Holt.
“’Tisn’t everybody who is fitted to be an airman.
One or two bad spills—an airplane
ready for the scrap pile, or a student now and
then killed on the training field, and it’s all
off with some!”</p>

<p>“If you don’t look out, Holt, we’ll elect you
chairman and sole member of our committee
on pessimism,” laughed Dorsey. “Say, son,”—he
addressed Don—“I suppose you have all
your papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and owing to my father having been
a member of a Franco-American aviation
corps I didn’t have much trouble in getting
them,” returned Don. “He’s now an instructor
in an American aviation school.”</p>

<p>“What did they do to you? I’d like to
know if your experiences were like my own.”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the story,” laughed the new
<span class='it'>élève</span><a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> pilot. “I hoofed it to the recruiting office,
which is located in the Invalides at
Paris, filled out a questionnaire, signed a document
requiring me to obey the military laws
of France and be governed and punished
thereby; then, after that agony was over, the
medical man took me in charge. I just had
to show him that I was able to balance myself
on one foot with eyes closed, jump straight
up from a kneeling position, and also walk a
straight line after having been whirled around
and around on a revolving stool until all the
joy in life seemed to have gone.”</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-044.jpg' alt='' id='illus-044'/>
<p class='caption'>“Spies are Everywhere”</p>
</div>

<p>“Ugh!” grunted Dorsey. “The very
recollection of that ordeal makes me wish to recollect
something else.”</p>

<p>“The kind of air-sickness you get by the
unearthly dips and twists of an airplane has
sea-sickness beaten to a frazzle,” commented
Ben Holt, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Then I’m not anxious to make its acquaintance,”
grinned Don. “I had a few
nerve tests, too, made in a pitch-dark room,
which weren’t altogether pleasant. Among
other things, a revolver was unexpectedly
fired several times close beside me.”</p>

<p>“It’s tough, how they treat a perfectly
respectable chap,” chirped Cal Cummings.</p>

<p>“My, what a relief it was to receive a service
order requiring me to report to the headquarters
of the Flying Corps of Dijon!”</p>

<p>“That’s an old story with us,” drawled
Mittengale. “Once there, you had to answer
a lot more questions. Then you paid a visit
to the ‘Vestiare,’ where the soldiers are outfitted.
A uniform, shoes, socks, overcoat, hat
and knapsack were passed out, and thereby,
and also perforce, another chapter added to
your brief but eventful history.”</p>

<p>“Besides all that, I received a railroad pass
to come here, and also three sous, representing
that many days’ pay,” chuckled the new
candidate. “The salary I’ve already squandered,”
he confessed, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Awful! The French Government should
be told about it,” exclaimed Gene Shannon,
laughingly. “But now, son, perhaps you
would like to begin a new chapter by paying
the captain a very necessary call?”</p>

<p>“To be sure!” said Don.</p>

<p>He stooped over, preparatory to gathering
up his belongings, when Shannon stopped
him.</p>

<p>“Leave the department store there, Don,”
he remarked. “We’ll send some of the
Annamites over to wrestle with ’em. Now
come along.”</p>

<p>The “Annamites,” both Don and George
knew, were the little yellow-skinned Indo-Chinese,
who had journeyed from far-off Asia
to give their services to the French Government.</p>

<p>Led by Tom Dorsey, the crowd began to
pilot the new student and his chum toward
headquarters. To Don Hale it was all wonderfully
interesting. The boy was filled with
that eager curiosity and anticipation which is
one of the glorious possessions of youth. A
new life—indeed a startlingly strange life,
would soon be opening out before him—one
that held vast possibilities, and also terrifying
dangers. Whither would it lead him?</p>

<p>“I say, young chap”—Ben Holt’s voice
broke in upon his thoughts—“you’ve got to
mind your eye in this place. No talking
back to officers; no overstaying your leave,
eh, Monsieur Nightingale?”</p>

<p>“Oh, cut it out!” snapped Mittengale.</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a chap who knows!” Holt
chuckled. “One day Roy thought he’d enjoy
a few extra hours in Paree—result: a nice
little chamber two stories underground; a
rattling good wooden bench, but uncommonly
hard, as a bed; a bottle of water for company
and eight days of delightful idleness, to
meditate upon the inconsiderate ways of
military men.”</p>

<p>“It was well worth it,” growled Mittengale.
“Some tender-hearted chaps smuggled in
paper and I wrote sixty-four pages of my
book entitled ‘Life and Adventures of an
Airman in France!’”</p>

<p>“An airman in France!” snickered Ben.
“There’s nerve for you! Why, he hasn’t
even been above the three hundred foot level
yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just about two hundred and
seventy-five feet higher than your best record,”
retorted Mittengale, witheringly. “Don’t talk,
you poor little grasshop.”</p>

<p>Don Hale paid no attention to these pleasantries,
for, at that moment, one of the distant
machines circling aloft, now dusky, gray
objects, sometimes but faintly visible in the
darkening sky, began to volplane. Down,
down, came the biplane, in wide and graceful
spirals, toward the earth. A few more turns
and the wings were silhouetted faintly for the
last time against the sky; another instant
and they cut across the turf in still swiftly
moving lines of grayish white.</p>

<p>“Good work, that!” cried Don, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Fine!” agreed George.</p>

<p>“Won’t I be jolly glad when I can manage
a machine like that!” Don happened to
glance at his chum’s face, and was surprised
to see a swift, subtle change come across it, an
almost sad expression taking the place of his
usual buoyant look. “What’s the matter, old
chap?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking what a dangerous life you
are about to begin, Don. As some of the boys
in the squadron say: ‘Death is often carried
as a passenger by the airman.’”</p>

<p>“And you engaged in the very same work
yourself!” laughed Don. “There’s consistency
for you! I understand, though, just
how you feel about it, George. Honestly, at
times, I’ve worried a whole lot about you.
But”—a determined light flashed into his
eyes—“we must ‘carry on’ the big job before
us.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way to look at it,” acquiesced
George, heartily. “You have a cool head and
steady nerves, Don; and you’ll be called upon
to use all your wits, all your courage and
resourcefulness, as never before in the whole
course of your life. Great adventures are
ahead!”</p>

<p>“Better wait until he gets out of the
ground-class before talking that way,” grinned
Ben Holt, dryly.</p>

<p>“Don’t discourage the infant class, Holt,”
put in Dorsey. “Now, boys ”—he turned to
face Don and George—“that good-sized building
you spy just across the field is the headquarters
of the captain and moniteurs—teachers
we call ’em in the good old lingo of
the United States. By the way, know much
French?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Don.</p>

<p>“Good! Frankly speaking, some of these
chaps here do not.” Dorsey chuckled mirthfully.
“Their efforts sound weird and wild.
And sometimes it has the effect of making
the moniteurs act wildly and weirdly.”</p>

<p>“The idea of Dorsey talking about French!”
scoffed Ben Holt. “Why, he can’t even speak
English. An Englishman’s the authority for
that.”</p>

<p>“One’s shortcomings should never be
mentioned in polite society,” grinned Tom.
“And now, Don, while you’re over there
parleying the parlez-vous we’ll get a bunch
of the Oriental Wrecking Crew, the Annamites,
to lift your traps.”</p>

<p>“As a rule, I rather object to having my
things lifted,” laughed Don. “But this time
it’s all right.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find our crowd, with a few additions
equally handsome, in the big barracks—the
third from the end. Now scoot.”</p>

<p>While Don and George didn’t exactly
“scoot,” they nevertheless immediately left
the group and made good time toward the
building indicated. Within a few minutes
they entered and were conducted by an
orderly to the captain’s sanctum.</p>

<p>If Don had expected any effusive greeting
or words of commendation for his willingness
to give his services to aid the cause of France
he would have been greatly disappointed.
The captain, very alert and authoritative in
manner, greeted the two boys in a casual, disinterested
sort of way, and examined Don’s
papers.</p>

<p>Then came the usual number of formalities
and an order to report to the sergeant on the
aviation field on the following morning.</p>

<p>Don Hale was now duly enrolled as an
<span class='it'>élève</span>, or student pilot, in one of the most important
of the great Bleriot flying schools in France.</p>

<p>A pleasant refreshing breeze was springing
up as Don Hale, with his chum, left headquarters
and hastened toward the barracks
which was to be his temporary home.</p>

<p>There were plenty of signs of life about the
great plateau, and occasionally voices came
over the air from the distance with peculiar
distinctness. By this time all nature had become
gray and sombre, and the slowly advancing
shadows which heralded the approach
of dusk were enveloping the distant hangars
and tents and merging the vast, sweeping line
of the horizon almost imperceptibly into the
coldish tones of the sky.</p>

<p>Here and there lights were beginning to
flash into view. From barrack windows,
from tents and outbuildings, they shone—each
little sparkling, star-like beam carrying with
it a message of good cheer and welcome.</p>

<p>Just before Don and George reached the
barracks designated by Tom Dorsey, over the
door of which was painted in very large black
letters “Hotel d’Amerique,” a loud and lusty
chorus, composed of French and American
voices, accompanied by a piano, started up,
singing with ludicrous effect:</p>

<p>“The Yanks are Coming.”</p>

<p>Then, as the last words were carried off on
the breeze, the momentary silence that ensued
was broken by a loud-voiced student standing
by the window, who bawled:</p>

<p>“True enough, boys!—the Yanks are not
only coming, but they’re here.”</p>

<p>The aviators immediately crowded to the
window, and even before Don and George
entered the building, which was to the accompaniment
of that well-known classic: “Hail,
hail! The gang’s all here!” they had received
a noisy and good-natured welcome.</p>

<p>A smiling and dapper little Frenchman was
the first to shake them by the hand; and
having performed this act with much gravity
he immediately struck an attitude and began
to recite, in the manner of a schoolboy who
has memorized a piece:</p>

<p>“Gentlemens, excuse the bleatings of a
little chump who should remain silent before
he speaks. Permit me to say, however, that
you may use me as a doormat when it is your
will and I shall be overwhelmed with joy.
And now having bored you to tears I will desist.”</p>

<p>He ended the oration, which some of the
fun-loving, mischievous Americans had taught
him, with a low bow, evidently much surprised
at the chuckles and gurgles of mirth
which ran through the room.</p>

<p>Don Hale laughingly made a speech in reply,
quite astonishing the Frenchmen present
by his ready command of their tongue.</p>

<p>And during it all he had been observing
his new home with keen curiosity and lively
interest. The interior of the long but rather
low wooden structure was whitewashed, and
ranged alongside each wall were rows of beds.
They were makeshift affairs, however, consisting
of a couple of sawhorses with a plank
thrown across. Over the top had been placed
a mattress, looking as though it had done
long and valiant service.</p>

<p>“Clearly, the <span class='it'>élèves</span> are expected to rough it
a bit,” thought Don.</p>

<p>It would be a strange boy indeed, however,
who objected to roughing it—Don Hale, at
least, was not one of that kind.</p>

<p>The lad was glad to discover that the room
was evidently occupied by Frenchmen, as
well as by his own compatriots. At one end
large posters made by some of the best known
artists of France adorned the wall, while at
the other were pictures clearly of American
origin.</p>

<p>Tom Dorsey made the introductions, adding
a word or two, in a jocular fashion, about the
characteristics of each. Very naturally, the
new student took a decided interest in studying
the Americans with whom he would
be so closely associated during the weeks to
come.</p>

<p>“Among those present” were men of striking
dissimilarities in appearance—of widely
different stations in life—of various degrees
of wealth; but the call of adventure, having
brought them all together, had also served to
unite them in a common spirit of comradeship
perhaps impossible under other circumstances.
There was, for instance, Dave Cornwell,
of New York, of the beau monde of
Fifth Avenue, with aristocracy imprinted unmistakably
on his clean-cut features. And in
striking contrast to him was Sid Marlow,
cowpuncher of Montana, deck hand on a
Mississippi steamboat, longshoreman, and,
lastly, fighter in the Foreign Legion. In fact,
the majority of the American <span class='it'>élèves</span> had seen
service in that famous branch of the French
army, which had recruited its members from
all parts of the world. No embarrassing questions
were asked; an applicant’s antecedents
mattered little; he was given a chance to retrieve
whatever mistakes he may have made,
and, perhaps, through the fiery ordeal of
battle, come out a vastly superior man.</p>

<p>Several of the students particularly attracted
Don Hale’s attention, one of them being
T. Singleton Albert, referred to by his companions
as “Drugstore”; for he had at one time
been a drugstore clerk and soda-water dispenser
in Syracuse. Albert was a rather
effeminate looking little chap, who seemed
wholly out of place in an aviation school. He
appeared diffident to the point of shyness,
and his voice, delicate and refined, was seldom
heard. Don Hale wondered if he would ever
make a flyer, a profession in which courage
and daring are such prime requisites.</p>

<p>Another boy who interested the new student
greatly was Bobby Dunlap, who had had
the singular cognomen of “Peur Jamais”
thrust upon him. Tom Dorsey airily explained
that on one occasion a student had
demanded in French of Bobby if he experienced
fear during a certain offensive in which
the Foreign Legion took part, whereupon
Bobby had blurted out the words
“Peur?—Jamais!—Fear?—Never!” in such a strenuous
and convincing tone as to create a big
laugh—also a new title for himself, and one
that persistently stuck.</p>

<p>There was a certain reserve and hauteur in
the manner of a third young chap named
Victor Gilbert which somehow appealed to
Don Hale, suggesting to his imaginative mind
that Gilbert’s sphere in life was, or rather had
been, a little different from that of most of
his fellow students.</p>

<p>Conversation was going on briskly when a
rumble of wheels outside made Don hurry to
the window.</p>

<p>“It’s the camion bringing in some of the
real birds from the <span class='it'>grande piste</span>, or principal
flying field, which is a good long way from
here,” volunteered Peur Jarnais. “Those
chaps are the stuff—yes, sir. By Jove, they’d
make an eagle jealous! Eagles can’t fly upside
down, can they? Of course not; but
some of our boys can.”</p>

<p>“It’s a great life if you don’t weaken,” put
in Tom Dorsey.</p>

<p>“Ever feel any symptoms of it?” asked
Don, smilingly.</p>

<p>“Sure!—a hundred times.”</p>

<p>“I never did,” put in Drugstore, in his
mild, weak voice. “To-morrow,” he cleared
his throat and paused impressively, his manner
indicating that some information of vast
importance was about to be
communicated—“to-morrow ”—another instant of hesitation,
and he began again—“to-morrow I’m going
to make my first flight in the air.”</p>

<p>“That means flying at an altitude of
twenty-five feet at most,” giggled Mittengale.</p>

<p>“I reckon it also means a machine smashed
to bits in landing,” chirped Peur Jamais.
“They say it costs the French government an
average of five thousand dollars to train its
aviators. I’ll bet in your case, Drugstore,
they’ll get off cheap at ten thousand.”</p>

<p>Don Hale, his head thrust out of the window,
now saw the returning aviators tumbling
off the big camion which had halted before
the door.</p>

<p>In another moment they bustled into the
barracks, and the yellowish rays of the oil
lamps fell with strange and picturesque effect
across their forms. Each was encased in a
great leather coat and trousers and wore a
helmet made from the same heavy material.
Several, too, still had on their grotesque-looking
goggles.</p>

<p>“They make me think of Arctic explorers,”
declared Don, with a delighted little laugh.</p>

<p>Don was experiencing a pleasurable sensation,
not unmixed with a certain sense of awe.
Here, right before him, were actually some of
the men who but a short time before had been
piloting their machines at dizzy heights in
the sky. The fascination of it all seemed to
grip him strangely—to make him impatient
and anxious to begin his initiation into the
art of flying.</p>

<p>“Another little eaglet, sir, ready to carry
terror into the heart of the Kaiser.”</p>

<p>In these words Tom Dorsey was introducing
him to one of the “real birds.”</p>

<p>The aviator was only a young chap, not
many years older than Don, but, like many
of the Americans and Frenchmen present, he
had allowed his face to remain unshaven, and
the resulting growth of beard gave him quite
an appearance of maturity.</p>

<p>“There’s a big lot of difference between the
way flying schools are conducted over here
and in America and Canada,” volunteered the
aviator, whose name, Don learned, was Hampton
Coles. “On our side of the big pool
discipline is probably as strict as in any other
branch of the army. We go in for drills and
all that sort of thing, while in France, at least
at present, the schools are only semi-military
in character. The object is to turn out flyers
as quickly as possible, which means casting a
whole lot of theories, red tape and non-essentials
into the junk heap. Flyers are
needed—badly needed. The ‘eyes of the
army,’ they call them.”</p>

<p>“At what time does work begin?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“We’re in our planes shortly after dawn.
At nine o’clock the first session is over; then
it’s back to the barracks. Dinner is served at
one o’clock, and after that the boys are free to
do what they please until five. On our return
to the <span class='it'>piste</span>, or flying field, we usually
keep steadily at it until nearly dark.”</p>

<p>“How does it happen that so many are
here at this hour?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this crowd only represents a small
portion of the students who, for one reason or
another, stopped work a bit early,” replied
Hampton. “In all, we have about one hundred
and twenty-five men, and among them
are several Russians—daring chaps they are,
too, but rather poor flyers.”</p>

<p>“But the Americans seem pretty good at
it, eh?”</p>

<p>Hampton Coles laughed.</p>

<p>“The moniteurs are always bawling out
some of the best <span class='it'>élèves</span> for doing unnecessary
and risky stunts,” he declared. “I imagine
they think we’re a reckless, hair-brained lot.
However”—his tone suddenly sobered; his
eyes were turned thoughtfully off into the
distance—“it doesn’t do to take many chances
in the air. It’s mighty tricky; and so are
the machines. Some of our boys have already
paid the penalty. Yes, it’s a dangerous game,
son.”</p>

<p>“Which only makes it a lot more interesting,”
put in Drugstore, quietly.</p>

<p>“To be sure!” laughed Coles. “But, as
this rig o’ mine is getting to feel prominent,
I’ll skip.”</p>

<p>Jack Norworth presently sauntered over to
tell Don that in order to get a bed he would
have to go to the commissary depot, about a
half mile distant.</p>

<p>“I’ll hoof it with you,” he volunteered.</p>

<p>“Good!” said Don.</p>

<p>George and Drugstore elected to accompany
them; so the four immediately left the
Hotel d’Amerique, and, through the slowly-gathering
shades of night, started off.</p>

<p>“By the way, where are you staying?”
asked Jack, turning to George Glenn.</p>

<p>“At a hotel in the little village of Étainville,”
replied the young member of the Lafayette
Squadron.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s at Étainville that we have our
club!” cried Jack.</p>

<p>“A club?” queried Don, interestedly.</p>

<p>“Sure thing!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like clubs,” commented Drugstore.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, the fellows are always calling upon a
chap to tell a story, make a speech or do
something else to amuse ’em,” returned
Drugstore, rather hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Some can do that sort of thing, but not
I.” The former dispenser of soda-water spoke
in plaintive tones. “Half the time I can’t
think of the words I want and when I do
think of ’em they’re not the right ones.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what you need is a correspondence
school course in the art of self-expression—‘think
on your feet; latent power aroused;
trial lesson free; send no money,’” chuckled
Jack.</p>

<p>“Let’s hear about the club,” said Don.</p>

<p>“It meets in a typical little inn called the
Café Rochambeau. The floor is of sanded
brick; there are cobwebs everywhere; cats
and dogs wander in and out. It’s all rustic,
dusty and charming. Say, George, have
supper at our mess to-night, then, afterward,
you and Don can travel over with the
bunch.”</p>

<p>“Thanks! I’ll be delighted,” said George.</p>

<p>The four soon reached the commissary
depot. Attendants dragged from its generous
supply of stores the necessary portions of the
bed and delivered them to the boys. Quite
naturally, the march back, hampered as they
were by the cumbersome articles, did not
prove to be agreeable. Finally, however,
rather hot and tired, they reached the Hotel
d’Amerique.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes to put the rude
contrivance called a bed together in its place
alongside the wall, and by this time the crowd
was being considerably augmented by the students
returning from the <span class='it'>piste</span>.</p>

<p>“Come along, you chaps! I’ll pilot you to
the grub department,” exclaimed Peur
Jamais. “It won’t make you think of the
Waldorf Astoria.”</p>

<p>“Never mind! They’ve got things on the
menu the Waldorf hasn’t,” chuckled Gene
Shannon.</p>

<p>“For instance?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“Horse-meat.”</p>

<p>“I’m game,” laughed the new student.</p>

<p>Less than five minutes later Don and
George, at the head of the advance-guard,
reached the dining-hall. They found it a
crude, unpretentious structure exteriorally,
and equally crude and unpretentious in regard
to its interior arrangements. The tables
were of rough boards, and tabourets, or stools,
took the place of chairs.</p>

<p>The mess-hall was soon filled with a noisy,
jolly crowd. Clearly, the hazardous nature of
the work had no distressing effects on the
minds of the <span class='it'>élèves</span>. To judge by the manner
of those present, theirs might have been the
least dangerous of professions; yet, nevertheless,
the talk often reverted to the accidents
or near-accidents which had occurred on the
flying field. But it was the keen enthusiasm
of all that especially appealed to Don Hale.
Probably none among the gathering enjoyed
the meal more than he. The dim, fantastic
light cast by the oil lamps, the sombre ever-changing
shadows on faces and forms, the
grotesque and larger shadows that sported
themselves on the four walls, the shrouded,
obscured corners, all added their share to the
charm and novelty.</p>

<p>A particularly fastidious person could very
easily have found fault with the meal, which
consisted of soup, meat, mashed potatoes,
lentils, war bread and coffee. The horse-meat
was tough, the lentils rather gritty, as though
some of the soil in which they were planted
had determinedly resolved to stand by them
to the end. But to hungry men, whose lives
in the open meant healthy, vigorous appetites,
such little unconventionalities in the art of
cooking were of but trifling importance.</p>

<p>As the students were filing out, not in the
most orderly fashion, into the clear, moonlit
night, Jack Norworth joined Don and George.</p>

<p>“All ready, boys, for the Café Rochambeau?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You bet we are!” cried Don.</p>

<h1 id='chIII'>CHAPTER III—SPIES</h1>

<p>To reach the peaceful village of Étainville,
which, more fortunate than many another in
France, had never known the horror and
tragedy of war, it was necessary to pass
through several little patches of woods. That
walk with a number of his compatriots proved
to be a very delightful one to Don Hale.
Nature, in the soft, greenish moonlight, which
filtered in between the foliage and ran in
straggling lines and patches on the underbrush
or fell in splotches on the trunks and
branches, presented a very poetic—a very
idyllic appearance. Here and there, amid
the pines and firs, gnarled, rugged oaks, ages
old, reared their spreading branches against
a cloudless sky. A fragrant, delightful odor,
like incense, nature’s own, filled the air; and
the gentle sighing of leaves and grasses swayed
to and fro by a capricious breeze joined with
the ever constant chant of the insect world of
the woods.</p>

<p>Étainville possessed only one main street, a
cobbled, winding highway, lined on either
hand with picturesque and sometimes dilapidated
houses. Near the centre of the village
rose the ancient church, the tall and graceful
spire of which could be seen over the countryside
for many miles. The twentieth century
is a busy and a bustling age. Progress, ever
on the alert, fairly leaps ahead, but it seemed
to have carefully avoided Étainville in its
rapid march.</p>

<p>Of all its inhabitants, none was better
known or liked than old Père Goubain, proprietor,
as was his father and grandfather before
him, of the Café Rochambeau. Père
Goubain was very fat—so fat, indeed, that he
sat practically all day long in a big armchair.
During the winter it was generally in the
main room of the café, before the big round
stove near the centre; but the summer days
generally found him comfortably installed in
the garden which enclosed the old stuccoed
building.</p>

<p>Père Goubain appeared to be the very personification
of contentment, except, however,
when the Germans happened to be mentioned
within his hearing. Then, his rubicund face
became redder, his mild, blue eyes fairly
blazed with a fierce, vindictive light, and, altogether,
he looked quite ferocious indeed.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the Café Rochambeau and
the man who greeted the crowd of Americans.
To Don and George he was especially gracious.
He asked many questions, and delightedly
informed them that only the day before he
had actually seen a detachment of American
soldiers marching through the village street.</p>

<p>“Ah! and how grand they looked, mes
amis!” he cried. “With their help—‘On
les aura’—we shall get them! Ah, les
Boches!”</p>

<p>The placid look on his face was gone, and,
rising in his chair, he began to sing in a deep
bass voice:</p>

<div class='lgp'><div class='poetry-container'>
<p class='line0'>“‘Ye sons of freedom, wake to glory!</p>
<p class='line0'>Hark, hark, what myriads bid you rise!</p>
<p class='line0'>Your children, wives and grandsires hoary,</p>
<p class='line0'>Behold their tears and hear their cries!</p>
<p class='line0'>Behold their tears and hear their cries!</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall hateful tyrants, mischief breeding,</p>
<p class='line0'>With hireling hosts, a ruffian band,</p>
<p class='line0'>Affright and desolate the land,</p>
<p class='line0'>When peace and liberty lie bleeding?</p>
<p class='line0'>To arms—to arms, ye brave!</p>
<p class='line0'>Th’ avenging sword unsheathe,</p>
<p class='line0'>March on, march on, all hearts resolved</p>
<p class='line0'>On liberty or death.’”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block -->

<p>Vigorous indeed was the chorus which accompanied
Peré Goubain’s rendition of the
first stanza of the “Marseillaise,” and vigorous
indeed were the plaudits that resounded
throughout the room when the old Frenchman
sank back in his armchair.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Yanks are the boys to do it,”
exclaimed Peur Jamais. “Now, mes garçons—for
the council chamber!”</p>

<p>The “Council Chamber” was an apartment
adjoining the main room of the café. An oblong
table stood in the centre, smaller ones by
the walls; and there were plenty of chairs and
tabourets for the use of the Americans, for the
room practically belonged to them. Very
often old Pére Goubain honored the gathering
by his presence, and on this occasion he raised
his ponderous form, and, with lumbering
tread, followed his guests inside.</p>

<p>For their benefit Pére Goubain, a veteran
of the Franco-Prussian war, told several interesting
reminiscences about that memorable
conflict; then, abruptly, he branched off into
a subject which brought the old fiery look
back into his usually placid blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, what a wonderful system of espionage
the Boches have!” he exclaimed. “Its sinister
ramifications extend to every corner of
our great land and far beyond the seas.”</p>

<p>“Know anything about it?” queried Peur
Jamais, with interest.</p>

<p>“Listen, mes amis”—old Père Goubain
spoke gravely: “Many officers are among my
acquaintances. One of them belongs to the
French Flying Corps, and he, poor fellow,
while in a scouting plane far over the enemy’s
lines, had the great misfortune to be obliged
to descend in hostile territory.”</p>

<p>“Captured?” asked Peur Jamais, quite
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“He was. But”—a grim smile played
about the Frenchman’s mouth—“somehow,
he managed to make his escape, and, after the
most nerve-racking ordeals, succeeded in
reaching the Swiss frontier, and from thence
returned to France. In this very room, Messieurs,
he told me his experiences.”</p>

<p>Immediately, to Don Hale, and probably
also to a number of the others, that modest
interior became invested with a singular interest—with
a strange and subtle charm.
How wonderful to think that a man who had
passed through such harrowing adventures
should have actually been in that very place!</p>

<p>“And do you know,” continued Père Goubain,
with vehemence, “that when the German
officers learned the aviator’s name,
astounding as it may seem, they told him
many facts concerning his own history.”</p>

<p>“But how in the world did the Boches ever
learn them?” demanded Peur Jamais.</p>

<p>“As I said before, spies are everywhere;
one cannot know whom to trust. Listen, my
friends: not a hundred years ago, one of the
officers belonging to a training school was actually
discovered to be a spy.”</p>

<p>“Whew! That’s going some!” declared
Sid Marlow to Don, while Peur Jamais,
eagerness expressed in his eyes, began to look
curiously about him, as though vaguely suspicious
that perhaps some among those gathered
together were not all they pretended to
be.</p>

<p>Before Père Goubain could resume, several
newcomers, also Americans, bustled past the
door.</p>

<p>General interest was immediately aroused
by the discovery that one carried a bundle of
Parisian dailies.</p>

<p>But the old innkeeper had started to say
something, and he intended to finish.</p>

<p>“Yes, Messieurs, the Boches possess many
ways of obtaining information. For instance,
I learned from another officer that spies have
even boldly descended into the French or
British lines, flying in airplanes captured from
the Allies. Naturally, some of these pilots
spoke excellent French; others the English
tongue equally well. Naturally, also, having
all the appearance of belonging to the cause
of freedom and justice, they escaped suspicion
at the time, and were thus enabled to pick up
much valuable information.”</p>

<p>“Very interesting!” drawled one of the
late comers. “But what’s all that got to do
with Captain Baron Von Richtofen?”</p>

<p>“Captain Baron Von Richtofen?” cried
Peur Jamais, interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Never hear of him?”</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur Carrol Gordon.”</p>

<p>“I have,” said George, in an undertone to
Don.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll read something for your special
benefit, Mr. Peur Jamais.”</p>

<p>Thereupon, Carrol Gordon, the owner of
the prized bundle, having opened one of the
papers and allowed the yellowish glow of the
lamplight to fall across the page, began:</p>

<p>“‘Advices recently received from the western
theatre of battle state that the famous
Red Squadron of Death, commanded by Captain
Baron Von Richtofen, has again made
its appearance in several places along the
front.’”</p>

<p>“‘The Red Squadron of Death!’” echoed
Peur Jamais, something akin to awe in his
tone.</p>

<p>“‘The Red Squadron of Death!’” repeated
Don.</p>

<p>“Quite an impressive title, I’ll admit,” remarked
Carrol, smiling at the great interest
which the article had evidently aroused. He
resumed:</p>

<p>“‘The Albatross planes belonging to this
feared and death-dealing squadron are painted
a brilliant scarlet from nose to tail. All are
manned by pilots of the greatest skill and
daring; and only the most experienced air
fighters of the Allies can expect to cope with
these crafty and dangerous enemies. The
bizarre idea of the red planes is no doubt an
attempt on the part of Captain Baron Von
Richtofen to instil fear into the hearts of the
Allied Flying Corps. At any rate, the reappearance
of this squadron, which claims to
have destroyed more than sixty allied planes,
heralds the near approach of many bitter
battles in the air.’”</p>

<p>As Carrol Gordon ceased reading he looked
around and remarked:</p>

<p>“Some news, eh? Now how many of you
are going to pack your trunks and slide for
home?”</p>

<p>“And to think of T. Singleton Albert, the
great soda-water clerk of Syracuse, going up
against such a game as that!” put in Tom
Dorsey, irrelevantly. “Poor Drugstore!”</p>

<p>“One thing to remember always is this,
mes garçons,” exclaimed old Père Goubain,
nodding his head sagely: “Imagination is a
very wonderful thing, and the Boche Baron
must realize the hold it has on certain natures.
Imagination, mes amis, can have the effect of
glorifying the most ordinary and commonplace
of objects and detracting from the most
sublime. It can rob the heart of determination
and destroy hope, and, equally well, it
can raise a man’s courage to such heights as
to place him on the pinnacle of fame. Bah,
I say, for the Baron’s red birds!” The innkeeper
snapped his fingers derisively. “I
cannot believe that any air fighters of the
Allies would be frightened by a few cans of
paint.”</p>

<p>“Well spoken, Père Goubain!” laughed
Hampton Coles. “Yours are the words of a
wise man; which proves that an innkeeper
can be a philosopher as well as a server to the
material needs of humanity.”</p>

<p>“How would you like to be a combat pilot
and meet the Baron, yourself?” asked Jack
Norworth, quizzically.</p>

<p>“It would be quite impossible, mon garçon,”
sighed Père Goubain. “My weight, alas I
would sink the ship.”</p>

<p>“Shall I give him a message from you if
we should happen to meet?” laughed George
Glenn.</p>

<p>“Yes, and let it be accompanied by a fusillade
of machine gun bullets.”</p>

<p>Don Hale thoroughly enjoyed his evening
at the club. Instinctively he felt that it was
a sort of dividing line between ease and comfort
and a strenuous existence, with dangers
and perils ever present from the moment he
became in actuality an <span class='it'>élève</span> pilot of the École
Militaire d’Aviation de Beaumont.</p>

<p>Finally good-byes were said to Père Goubain,
and the crowd filed into the great outdoors.
The village street was enveloped in the soft
light of the moon, and but for the bark of a
distant dog would have been silent. The
stuccoed buildings rose pale and ghostlike, or
in sombre, mysterious tones, against the sky,
and deep shadows crossed the cobbled highway.
A few beams of light to cheer those
who might be astir came from the windows
of the ancient, time-worn hostelry, the Hotel
Lion d’Or, where George Glenn was staying.</p>

<p>At the entrance, Don and the others bid
the combat pilot of the Lafayette Squadron
good-night, and then the march back to the
flying field was begun. It was rather late
when they arrived at the barracks. The
excitement, the great desire to begin his schooling
and the new surroundings all tended to
drive sleepy feelings away from Don Hale.
But Mittengale very solemnly assured him
that unless he “hit the pillow” at once he
would be liable to have regretful feelings in
the morning.</p>

<p>“I know, because I know,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll ‘hit the pillow,’” laughed Don.</p>

<p>The sound of laughter and voices was
gradually ceasing as Don Hale climbed into
his bed.</p>

<p>Several of the lamps had been extinguished
and the interior of the big barracks certainly
appeared very sombre—very gloomy indeed.
Here and there details made a valiant effort
to reveal their presence, but, for the most
part, shadows, grotesque in shape, deep and
grim in tone, held the mastery.</p>

<p>Presently Don Hale’s impressions became a
little confused, and, within a very few minutes,
he was sleeping that sound and dreamless
slumber which is another of the glorious
possessions of youth.</p>

<h1 id='chIV'>CHAPTER IV—“PENGUINS”</h1>

<p>“I say, boy, wake up! Didn’t you hear
the bugle sound? The reveillé! Wake up,
for goodness’ sake! You’ll be late. It’s almost
three-thirty now. You have that early
morning feeling, eh?—a pippin of a feeling,
too! I know, because I know!”</p>

<p>The sense of this string of words, jerked
out with extraordinary rapidity by Roy Mittengale,
was quite lost on Don Hale’s mental
faculties, but, nevertheless, they had exactly
the effect the speaker intended. With a start
and a half-stifled gasp, the new student sat up.</p>

<p>Morning! Was it possible that morning
had already come? Of course not! He
hadn’t before suspected Mittengale of being a
practical joker. Morning, indeed! He felt
quite vexed—quite exasperated, in fact.</p>

<p>The effects his eyes took in were precisely
similar to those he had seen on retiring—the
same glimmering yellowish lights, the same
lurking shadows, the long row of windows
framing in the palish moonlight of the outside
world.</p>

<p>He was about to protest. But before he
had time the big room, all at once, became
filled with noise and commotion—with the
sounds of men jumping out of bed, of men
talking, of men hurrying and bustling about
as though their very lives depended upon the
swiftness of their movements.</p>

<p>So, after all, Roy wasn’t a practical joker.</p>

<p>“All right! All right!” mumbled Don.
“I’ll get right up.”</p>

<p>“You’d better,” continued Mittengale,
laughingly.</p>

<p>Don Hale certainly had that early morning feeling,
besides being cold and shivery; but,
though he devoutly wished that he might enjoy
a few minutes more of repose, he slipped
off the mattress and fairly jumped into his
clothes. By the time Don had finished
dressing he was alone.</p>

<p>A swift dash for the door and a brisk run
after leaving the barracks enabled him, however,
to overtake speedily the more tardy
students.</p>

<p>It was still a calm, serene moonlight night,
with the stars dimmed by the greater lustre
of the earth’s satellite, and no hint, no trace
of color in the eastern sky to herald the approach
of another day.</p>

<p>The destination of the hurrying crowd Don
found was the wash-house situated not far
away; and on arriving there he discovered
that certainly “all the comforts of home” appeared
to be lacking.</p>

<p>A dash of cold water over his face and arms
made the boy feel the need of brisk exercise
to counteract the effects of the damp, penetrating
chilliness of that early matinal hour.
Moisture glistened and sparkled on the tufts
of grass, and low over the earth stretched long
ghostly streamers of mist. High up in the
heavens a flock of unseen crows, flying swiftly
past, sent their cries far over the crisp, fresh
air, but, rapidly, distance softened and then
stifled the unmusical chorus.</p>

<p>A rush back to the barracks with the rest
of the students put warmth into Don Hale’s
shivery frame.</p>

<p>“Get in line, son, for the roll call,” commanded
Tom Dorsey.</p>

<p>In an orderly double column the students
ranged themselves alongside the barracks, an
officer appeared and the formality began.</p>

<p>Proudly, the new student answered “present”
as he heard his name pronounced by
the officer.</p>

<p>“Now I suppose we’ll get a bite to eat,” he
remarked to Mittengale, when the men broke
ranks.</p>

<p>“Your ‘suppose’ is all wrong,” chuckled
the other. “Now you’ll learn what you’re
up against.”</p>

<p>“I suspect I’m up against a joker,” laughed
Don.</p>

<p>But, again, his suspicion proved to be quite
unfounded. The men were forming in line,
and a few minutes later the march for the flying
field began. The day for which Don
Hale had looked forward so long—so expectantly—actually
had come. His nerves,
responding to the emotions aroused within
him, were tingling, but tingling in a most delightful
fashion.</p>

<p>The very faintest trace of delicate color, announcing
the coming of day, now slowly began
to suffuse itself in the eastern sky. It
was a cheerless and a gloomy hour, not an
hour, surely, for drooping spirits to be abroad;
but, fortunately, there appeared to be no drooping
spirits among that semi-military line of
marching men.</p>

<p>Gradually the long row of curved-roofed
hangars, partially hidden by the veils of
mists, loomed forth more clearly. Before the
head of the line had reached the first of the
immense flying fields—there were three—numerous
mechanics were rolling rather battered-looking
little monoplanes from beneath
the protecting shelter of the canvas coverings
and placing them side by side in long lines.</p>

<p>“I say, my young knight of the air, cast
your optics upon the ‘penguins,’” called
Mittengale, who happened to be marching
just ahead.</p>

<p>Don Hale, however, required no such invitation.
He was already studying the machines
with the most intense—the most eager
interest. “Penguins,” he knew, are Bleriot
monoplanes, the wings of which have been so
shortened as to render the machines powerless
to lift themselves from the ground; hence
the rather curious appellation of “penguins,”
birds of that name not being able to fly.</p>

<p>Certainly the “penguins” had an extraordinary
fascination for the new candidate. To
his active mind they suggested huge dragon-flies—all
ready to wing their way lightly to
other parts.</p>

<p>A few moments later the boy was standing
before the nearest machine. Now every semblance
to a military line had vanished. Students,
moniteurs, mechanics and laborers were
all mingling together before the hangars.</p>

<p>Some time later, while he was still regarding
the machines with an absorbing degree
of interest, the voice of the head instructor
broke sharply in upon his thoughts.</p>

<p>In loud tones he was calling out the names
of various students and designating the numbers
of the machine they were to use. Immediately
the future airmen began jumping into
their places, and before many moments had
passed every “penguin” in the long line had
an occupant.</p>

<p>“Goodness! I certainly feel like an outsider,”
murmured Don. “I reckon I’d better
hunt up the sergeant and——”</p>

<p>At that second the air became surcharged
with a series of startling staccato explosions,
with roars, great crashes and bangs, quite
ear-splitting in their intensity—the motors
were being tested. Gradually the rising crescendo,
suggestive of some strange, wild symphony,
reached its greatest climax, and then
as slowly began to subside. And presently,
in its place, came the soft, pleasant drone and
hum of many smoothly-working motors and
propellers.</p>

<p>Now the highly interested Don Hale saw
the assistants removing the blocks from beneath
the wheels of the “penguins” and
heard the moniteurs giving their pupils a few
final words of advice.</p>

<p>“By Jove, don’t I wish I were in one of
’em!” he muttered. “Ah!”</p>

<p>The assistants were giving the propellers of
some of the nearer machines a swift turn;
and as the whirling blades became but misty
circles the strange “birds” got into action.</p>

<p>“By Jove!”</p>

<p>This time Don Hale uttered the exclamation
aloud.</p>

<p>A number of “penguins” had begun to
“taxi” across the field, and were soon traveling
at a most tremendous speed. Some
twisted and staggered about, as though, every
instant, they must topple over sideways and
smash their wings against the turf. Others
exhibited every indication of halting their onward
rush and spinning around and around
like a top, while still others, as straight and
true as a swift breeze tearing its way across
the countryside, kept rapidly growing smaller
and fainter in the distance.</p>

<p>Yes, it truly was a remarkable spectacle
that Don Hale had before his eyes. In the
semi-darkness of that chill and early hour,
the rushing “penguins” seemed to resemble
a flock of huge birds, full of life, full of
keen intelligence, rather than man-made machines.</p>

<p>There was a thrill and spice about the
scene, too, which caused involuntary gasps to
frequently come from the mouth of the student.
Now and again, “penguins,” while
traveling at a headlong pace, seemed about to
smash into one another. The boy almost held
his breath.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>One was down. Another, hustling past the
fallen “bird,” just graced its broken wing.
The game, even in the beginner’s class, was
clearly not without its dangers.</p>

<p>Now the most skilfully handled machines
had reached their destination—the flag at the
other end of the field—and were returning as
though borne on the blasts of a hurricane.
From faint, insignificant whitish specks they
became huge winged creatures in a moment
of time, seemingly intent upon crashing their
tempestuous way into the groups of moniteurs,
mechanics and assistants and even
through the hangars themselves.</p>

<p>The tense-faced pilots, however, stopped the
engines in time, and, one after another, the
“penguins” docilely came to a halt.</p>

<p>“Grand sport, sure enough!” cried Don,
delightedly. He would have imparted this
thought to others, too, but for the fact that
not one among those all around him was paying
the slightest attention to his presence. It
gave Don a rather unpleasant feeling, as
though he was of very little importance. It
also served to make him decide to report to
the sergeant of the first class at once.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he began walking toward the
nearest group; and then, for the first time,
he caught a glimpse of several of the Annamites
attached to the aviation camp. Picturesque-looking
little chaps they were, and
unmistakably of the Orient from their yellow
complexion and slanting, beady eyes to their
small and stocky stature. They were about
to cross the field. What was the meaning of
that intrusion?</p>

<p>All at once Don Hale understood; and,
instinctively, his eyes were turned toward the
fallen “penguin,” which, like a wounded
bird brought low by the huntsman’s bullet,
lay where misfortune had overtaken it. A
little crowd was collecting, and soon he discovered
three distant figures moving slowly
toward the hangars, the one in the centre
supported by those on either side.</p>

<p>“The pilot must have been injured,” thought
Don, commiseratingly.</p>

<p>In what seemed to be a very short time to
him the sun was almost on the horizon, and
eagerness to begin his task was gripping him
with a strange intensity; no small boy with
a lively and joyous anticipation of a visit to
the “greatest show on earth” could have experienced
more pleasurable sensations, and a
glance toward the flying fields beyond served
to even further increase them. Above the
one adjoining, Bleriot monoplanes were flying
at low altitudes; still further in the distance
he could see airplanes piloted by more advanced
members of the third and fourth class
momentarily mounting in the air. The flying
fields were beginning to show a pleasant
warmth of color, and the Farnum and Caudron
machines, high aloft, catching the sun’s
reflections, sent them constantly flashing
earthward. These planes possessed a certain
grace, but they were heavy and clumsy craft
indeed compared to several
single-seaters—Nieuport or Spad machines.
These far outclassing
the swiftest of the feathered tribe in
their flight, darted in and out, swooped downward
from dizzy heights or climbed upward
until their wings appeared as the faintest
gossamer lines against the soft, purplish tones
of the sky.</p>

<p>As Don set off in his quest for the sergeant
the majority of the “penguins” were racing
and tearing about the field in the most extraordinarily
erratic fashion.</p>

<p>Sergeant Girodet was easily found, but, to
Don Hale’s intense disappointment, the officer
informed him that he would have to wait
until the afternoon session, adding rather
dryly:</p>

<p>“Monsieur will be safe and sound for several
hours longer.”</p>

<p>Don laughed, rejoining:</p>

<p>“And for a good many hours after that, I
hope.”</p>

<p>The Annamites were now bringing in the
wrecked and battered plane, headed for the
repair shops, vast structures employing hundreds
and hundreds of skilled mechanics and
helpers. As they were near by and the night
shift still at work, Don concluded to pay them
a brief visit before journeying to the field
where the third class, of which T. Singleton
Albert was a member, flew in real airplanes to
a height of no less than twenty-five feet.</p>

<p>And just at this time the boy was overjoyed
to hear a familiar, cheery voice shouting:</p>

<p>“Hello, Don! Hello, old chap!”</p>

<p>Turning quickly, he spied his chum approaching.</p>

<p>“My, but I’m jolly glad to see you, George!”
he called. “Playing the part of a wallflower
isn’t a pleasant outdoor sport.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s good you don’t get up in the
air about it,” replied George, laughingly.
“That’s right—always keep your feet on the
ground.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to, even when I’m a few miles
high,” chirped Don.</p>

<p>George agreeing to Don’s plan, the two
began traveling after the guttural-speaking
Annamites.</p>

<p>“It strikes me ‘penguins’ ought to be
easily managed,” declared Don, reflectively.
“One just has to drive them in a straight line
across the <span class='it'>piste</span>.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all,” replied George. A
twinkling light shone in his eyes. “But——”</p>

<p>“Difficult, eh, old chap?”</p>

<p>And though George nodded emphatically,
Don, nevertheless, felt strongly inclined to
think that when once in the pilot’s seat he
would surprise not only his chum but a few
others as well.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the two reached the machine
and repair shops.</p>

<h1 id='chV'>CHAPTER V—TRAINING</h1>

<p>Americans, of course, enjoyed a great
popularity all over France, and, therefore,
Don and George were welcome guests at the
shops, which resembled huge manufacturing
plants. They immediately found themselves
surrounded by another kind of activity. The
din and hum of machinery, the clanging of
hammers, the explosive reports of motors
vibrated over the air, all symbolizing, as it
were, by means of sound, progress and labor.</p>

<p>“They build airplanes here as well as repair
them,” explained George.</p>

<p>As the two walked from one point to another
Don Hale marveled at what he saw.
The framework of hulls and of main planes,
the latter with their strong but slender supporting
spars, stood in long rows. Everywhere
skilled artisans, ordinary mechanics,
and helpers worked on various parts of the
planes. In the assemblage department Don
and George stopped to watch the winged
creations, one of the latest products of man’s
inventive genius, being put together. A foreman
greeted them pleasantly.</p>

<p>“And what do the young Americans think
of all this?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Simply wonderful!” responded Don, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Very true!” agreed the men. “Ah! the
art of airplane construction has advanced
amazingly since the great world war began,
mes Americaines. It is now a very exact
science, where the laws bearing upon lateral
and longitudinal balance, as well as many
other things, have to be rigorously observed.”</p>

<p>“I believe that before 1914 the German
equipment in the way of airplanes and
dirigible balloons was greatly superior to either
that of the French or English,” commented
George.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Boches had been doing everything
in their power to encourage the development
of both types of machines, while
the other nations, unmindful of the peril
which menaced them, were satisfied to let the
course of events in that particular direction
merely drift along.”</p>

<p>“The Germans are said to have had, in
addition to a fleet of huge Zeppelins, almost a
thousand airplanes of the finest construction,
while their aeronautical factories were rushing
work on others,” put in George. “France
possessed only about three hundred machines
and England still less, probably as few as two
hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“The Germans at that time held the
world’s record for height and sustained flying,”
declared Don Hale.</p>

<p>“Correct,” admitted the artisan. “They
thought, too, that with the supremacy of
their navy of the air, the supremacy of Great
Britain’s fleet on the sea could be more than
overcome and England invaded. But”—the
Frenchman clenched his fists—“our enemies—your
enemies—the enemies of the entire
world realize at last their error. They failed!
They failed! The supremacy of the air now
rests with the Allies.”</p>

<p>“And yet, for a while, the Germans had
the best scouting and fighting planes,” commented
George.</p>

<p>“Yes; the Fokkers. But La France replied
to that challenge by constructing the
famous Nieuport, the swiftest, the most easily
maneuvered airplane that flies. Come! Let
me show you a sample.”</p>

<p>Don and George, smiling a little at the
tremendous earnestness exhibited by the
Frenchman, followed him to another part
of the great shop, where the most skilled
workers were putting the finishing touches to
several Nieuports of the latest model. They
were delicate but staunch little machines—their
lines as graceful as those of any yacht;
and each was finished with a degree of care
and attention to detail which scarcely seemed
warranted when the perilous nature of the
career they were so soon to embark upon was
considered.</p>

<p>“What perfect beauties!” cried Don.
“Crickets, George! Don’t I wish all my
training period were over, so that I could
sail sky-high in one of these little rockets!”</p>

<p>“The speed of a rocket, Don, wouldn’t do
you very much good while flying over the
fighting front,” replied his chum, rather
grimly.</p>

<p>Don, too impatient, too restless to remain
much longer indoors, soon started off with the
other at his side. And all the while the
obliging artisan kept imparting interesting
bits of information. He told them something
about the giant bi-motored Caudron, the
Handley-Page and the Caproni, each type of
machine representing the highest achievement
in airplane building by the respective countries
of France, England and Italy.</p>

<p>“The Boches,” he added, with a scowl,
“have the Gothas.”</p>

<p>“I remember reading that some of the
Gothas which bombed London had a wing-spread
of seventy-eight feet, with motors of
two hundred and sixty horse power, and
carried, besides three men, hundreds of
pounds of explosives,” remarked Don.</p>

<p>“Seventy-eight feet is nothing these days,”
commented the Frenchman, musingly. “A
hundred and fifty is more like it. You and
I, mes Americaines, will live to see the time
when huge flyers, with comfortable accommodations
for passengers, can cross the Atlantic,
linking still closer the old world and the
new.”</p>

<p>Their volunteer guide now conducted the
boys to another department, where they saw
many women engaged in sewing together
breadths of fine linen cloth destined to be
stretched over the skeleton frames.</p>

<p>“Billions have been spent and are being
expended in the airplane industry,” continued
the man. “Even piano and furniture factories
and many others have turned their attention
to the fabrication of airplane parts,
such as struts, ribs and propellers. And all
this, in connection with aeronautic machinery,
means work for thousands of mechanics.
Vast quantities of raw material are required.
Airplanes must be housed: therefore the
erection of hangars and other types of buildings
will employ thousands more. Then, the
training of aviators, too, is a pretty expensive
operation.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” laughed Don. “However,
I’ll try to let ’em down as easily as I can.
Coming, George?”</p>

<p>After heartily thanking the obliging artisan
for his courtesy the two left the busy shops.</p>

<p>By this time the slowly-rising sun was
casting its first pale and delicate tints over
the earth. And with these rays the gloom
which had taken possession of nature for so
many hours began to lift. The dull and lifeless
landscape, freed from the embracing
mists, took on an aspect of quiet beauty and
charm, and drops of dew shone and sparkled
like “many a gem of purest ray serene.”</p>

<p>At a brisk walk Don and George set out for
the distant aviation field, and before very long
the ever moving “penguins” were left far to
the rear. Now Don and his chum had an
excellent view of the real flying machines, as
they winged their way in straight flights from
one end of the <span class='it'>piste</span> to the other, or taxied
over the ground to rise in the air with amazing
ease and lightness.</p>

<p>Another crowd of moniteurs, students and
mechanicians stood around, the moniteurs
following the movements of the planes with
the most critical attention.</p>

<p>One after another the flyers alighted, some
with ease and precision; some striking the
earth sufficiently hard to have thrown the
pilot out had he not been buckled to his seat.</p>

<p>“Whew! I’ll bet lots of planes are
smashed!” cried Don.</p>

<p>“You win,” said George, dryly. “Hello!
Look at the machine which just made that
bully landing. Whom do you see on the
pilot’s seat?”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! As I live, it’s Drugstore!”
burst out Don.</p>

<p>But as Don, unmindful of the moniteurs or
the crowd, left George’s side and rushed up to
congratulate him on his success, T. Singleton
Albert’s face didn’t have at all its usual half
shy and modest look. Instead, it rather
suggested the expression worn by some
mighty hero on the occasion of his greatest
triumph.</p>

<p>“Did you see me?” cried Drugstore, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>“Flying!—Why, there’s nothing to it, son.
Oh, boy! Only a perfect boob couldn’t handle
these ships.” Drugstore almost stuttered in
his elation and excitement. “But, take it
from me, son, some of these chaps here couldn’t
learn to drive an ash cart. Hello! I say,
Rogers”—he raised his voice—“did you see
me that time? I brought her down so easily
I didn’t even rumple the grass.”</p>

<p>“You’re up in the air right now, Singleton,”
chortled Rogers.</p>

<p>Albert, who had a pretty good command of
French, swelled up with even greater pride as
he listened to the moniteur’s “C’est bien
fait, mon ami—it was well done, my friend.”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon be bumping into the clouds,” he
declared, a confident grin on his face.</p>

<p>The machine was quickly turned around
by several Annamites, and then Drugstore,
yelling loudly for every one to get out of the
way, started his motor full blast; whereupon
the monoplane began to glide swiftly ahead.
As the machine attained a speed of about
forty miles an hour it gracefully left the terrestrial
globe several yards behind, and, like
an arrow shot from the archer’s bow, cut
through the still, silent air toward its distant
goal.</p>

<p>“Some flyer, that baby!” laughed Rogers.</p>

<p>And, indeed, his comments were just.
Very few of the other students were approaching
Albert’s performance. Their landings
were generally faulty—so faulty, in fact, as
to endanger the safety of plane and flyer
alike.</p>

<p>It was only a very short time before Drugstore’s
plane was seen returning. Don Hale
watched the machine rapidly growing larger
with breathless interest, fearful that Albert’s
great flush of enthusiasm might have engendered
so great a confidence in his ability as to
threaten his efforts with disaster. Exactly at
the proper moment, however, exactly in the
proper way, the Bleriot dipped; and then, exactly
in the proper manner, it struck the
earth, and, after rolling a certain distance,
came to a halt.</p>

<p>“Well, who said I couldn’t learn to fly!”
shouted Drugstore, hilariously. “Whoop!
It’s easier than slopping soda-water over a
shiny counter. Oh, boy, I’ll soon be able to
give an eagle lessons!”</p>

<p>It was now another pupil’s turn to take the
machine, and Albert, releasing the restraining
straps about his body, jumped stiffly to the
ground. His gait for several moments became
so noticeably uncertain as to bring forth
a volley of humorous observations.</p>

<p>“Success has gone to his head!” cried one.</p>

<p>“To his feet, you mean!” chuckled a
second.</p>

<p>“If that grin of his grows any wider his
face may be seriously injured!” chirped another.</p>

<p>“Speech, Drugstore, speech!” howled a
fourth.</p>

<p>If Albert had been his usual self all this
attention and good-natured raillery would
probably have brought a flush to his cheeks.
At that moment, however, Albert wasn’t quite
himself. He forgot to stammer and look embarrassed
as he declared importantly:</p>

<p>“Let’s see some of you chaps beat it. Oh,
boy, just a little while, and I’ll be shooting up
to hit the blue!”</p>

<p>Naturally Albert’s very excellent work
fired Don Hale with an even greater desire to
begin his apprenticeship at the fascinating
game of flying. The sun had never seemed
to ascend so slowly. Hours and hours must
pass before he could make his start. Really,
it was quite a strain on his nerves.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock work was over for the
morning, and the students trailed back to the
barracks, where they were privileged to remain
until five. The particular crowd which
occupied the Hotel d’Amerique found a
newcomer awaiting them. He was a very rosy-cheeked
young chap; and from his uniform,
still showing plentiful traces of mud and hard
usage, it was seen that he, too, had once been
a soldier in the famous Foreign Legion.</p>

<p>“My name is Dan Hagen,” he announced,
pleasantly. “I’m from Dublin.”</p>

<p>“Ah ha, boys, we now have with us Dublin
Dan!” chortled Roy Mittengale.</p>

<p>And that was the way in which Dan Hagen
received a new christening, and one that he
accepted with a boisterous, rollicking laugh.</p>

<p>“Call me anything; but don’t call me
down,” he said. “I say, how’s flying to-day?”</p>

<p>“As usual, up in the air,” laughed Tom
Dorsey.</p>

<p>“Next to me, who’s the newest greeny?”</p>

<p>A half dozen or so fingers were pointed
toward Don Hale; a half dozen or so voices
gave the desired information.</p>

<p>“Shake, old man!” exclaimed Dublin
Dan, extending a big rough hand. “It’s a
race between us to see which shall be the first
to feel the caressing touches of the wind-blown
clouds on our cheeks.”</p>

<p>“I’m on!” laughed Don.</p>

<p>“I say, did you see me land on my last
trip?”</p>

<p>T. Singleton Albert voiced this query. It
was addressed to no one in particular; and
as no one in particular paid the slightest
attention to it Drugstore became quite
peeved.</p>

<p>“Jealous, eh?” he jeered, with unexpected
bravado. “Jealous! Oh, boy! but my
cheeks’ll soon feel the caressing touches of
these wind-blown clouds. Some joyous expression
that, eh?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t beat yours at the present moment,”
declared big Sid Marlow, with a hearty
laugh.</p>

<p>Don Hale soon discovered that there was
little military discipline about the camp.
The students were perfectly free to amuse
themselves in any way their fancy dictated,
though Cal Cummings informed him that on
lecture days absence from the classes was considered
a pretty serious offense.</p>

<p>“I’d never want to play hooky,” declared
Don, smilingly.</p>

<p>The day, wearing on, brought with it plenty
of heat; therefore the shelter of the barracks
was soon sought by the majority. Little comfort
could be found inside, however. Swarms
of flies—“of every known size—of every
known species”—so Dublin Dan declared,
also used it as a hotel; and, not being of a
bashful disposition, they made themselves
unpleasantly conspicuous. At one o’clock
the little pests were sole masters of the situation,
while the crowd joined other crowds in
the spacious mess-hall.</p>

<p>During the meal T. Singleton Albert, having
been heard to remark: “I say, did you
see that last landing I made?” was loudly
and insistently called upon to make a speech.
Thereupon, he suddenly grew red in the face,
and when forced to his feet by strong-arm
methods stammered and stuttered to such a
degree that the boys, perceiving that he had
once more become the old, timid, shy Drugstore,
mercifully let him alone.</p>

<p>Following lunch a game of baseball was
played between two well-matched teams, one
of them being captained by Victor Gilbert.
Gilbert’s team won, which Cal Cummings declared
was not strange at all, considering the
fact that Victor had at one time been a crack
player on a college baseball club.</p>

<p>After the game was over, Don, George and
Dublin Dan set out for the aviation field together.</p>

<h1 id='chVI'>CHAPTER VI—DUBLIN DAN</h1>

<p>Don Hale, standing before a much battered
and bespattered “penguin,” experienced a delightful
thrill, which ran through his entire
being. Brimming over with ambition, equally
full of confidence, he could see nothing ahead
of him but success.</p>

<p>The moniteur in whose charge Don and
several others were placed was a rather youthful
and pleasant-spoken Frenchman. In a
quick, incisive fashion, he began to give a
little lecture on the airplane.</p>

<p>“The body is known as the fuselage,” he
explained. “At the front and just beneath
the wings, as you see, is the engine and propeller.
This particular type of plane, and in
fact the majority, are drawn and not pushed
through the air. The pilot is seated in the
cockpit immediately behind the motor. Two
rudders and two ailerons are placed at the
rear of the fuselage. The former, vertical, and
used for steering the plane horizontally, are
operated by a cross-piece of wood upon which
the pilot rests his feet. The ailerons are
horizontal, connected with a control stick by
means of wires, and, of course, tilt the plane
either up or down. The control stick is an
upright lever in front of the pilot’s seat.
These are details, however, that you need not
bother with now. Monsieur Hale, take your
place in number thirty-five. Monsieur Hagen
may use number twelve.”</p>

<p>Both boys immediately followed instructions,
and, after each had securely fastened
the belt designed to prevent an unceremonious
exit from the plane, the moniteur explained,
first to one and then the other, the proper
handling of the engine and rudders.</p>

<p>“The two most important things to remember,”
he said, “are to keep the tail off
the ground and the engine going at full speed.”</p>

<p>With his nerves at the keenest tension, Don
Hale waited for the command to start. Out
of the corner of his eye he could see groups
standing by the machine, watching him, it
seemed, in deadly silence. The familiar figure
of George Glenn among them nerved the boy
to do his utmost.</p>

<p>“Ready, sir?” asked the mechanician
standing by the propeller.</p>

<p>“Ready!” answered Don.</p>

<p>“Throw on the switch!”</p>

<p>With a hand that trembled in spite of all
his efforts to control it, Don Hale obeyed.</p>

<p>The mechanician whirled the propeller, and
in another moment the motor was emitting a
deafening roar; and in still another the
“penguin,” as though suddenly endowed with
life, began a headlong flight over the rather
uneven ground.</p>

<p>With all his senses keenly alert, Don Hale
felt the rushing wind fanning his cheeks;
and a sort of wild exhilaration took possession
of him as the “penguin,” like a runaway
locomotive, sent the ground speeding behind
at a rate which fairly dazzled his eyes.</p>

<p>But why did the “penguin” wobble and
stagger in such an extraordinary manner?</p>

<p>The more desperately Don strove to assert
his authority over the man-made bird the
more he seemed to lose his control. Now he
felt it swinging to the left; then, a too hasty
push with his foot on the steering apparatus
threatened to send it wildly careening off to
the right. Above the roar of the motor he
could faintly hear the shouts and yells of the
crowd which he was leaving so far behind.</p>

<p>The confidence which Don had felt before
jumping into the machine was given a rude
and unpleasant jolt; and, besides this, the
speed and erratic movements of the “penguin”
were so bewildering as to make the boy
lose, for a moment, his usual coolness. The
sudden thought, too, that George Glenn was
witnessing the almost absurd capering of the
“penguin” served only to add to his discomfiture
and apprehension.</p>

<p>In his tremendous eagerness to conquer the
difficulties, Don made a sudden movement
with the control stick, lifting the tail high
off the ground, and at the same time he added
to his mistake by pushing the rudder too far
around. The result was almost terrifying.
The “bird,” as though roused to sudden fury
by his action, began to whirl around and
around, its speed seeming to increase with
each passing second.</p>

<p>Dazed and dizzy the pilot had just
sufficient presence of mind left to shut off the
power. But the “penguin” had already begun
to somersault.</p>

<p>Don Hale experienced a chilling and sickening
fear. So suddenly that he could
scarcely realize what had happened, the airplane
tumbled over. He heard the sound of
breaking supports and felt the impact of a
blow. Then he found himself pinned to the
ground amidst a mass of wreckage.</p>

<p>Several seconds elapsed before he could
think coherently enough to decide that beyond
a few bruises and scratches he had not
been injured. And, although the “penguin”
was as motionless as though it had never
made a movement in the whole of its checkered
career, the ground still seemed to be
whirling rapidly before his eyes. But the dizziness,
the pains and aches he was experiencing
were as nothing compared to his disillusionment.
He had fully expected to make a
grand and triumphal trip straight across the
flying <span class='it'>piste</span> to the flag which marked the end
of the course and to hear the plaudits of
George, the praise of the moniteur and the
comments of the admiring crowd. And here
he was—in an undignified heap, with the
breath almost knocked out of his body, and
responsible for the ending of the tempestuous
career of what had been but a few moments
before a staunch and sturdy “penguin.”</p>

<p>Oh yes, he must have surprised his chum
George Glenn—of that there couldn’t be the
slightest doubt!</p>

<p>As Don began painfully to extricate himself,
with grim forebodings of what the consequences
of the disaster might be, he became
conscious of the fact that from almost every
point people were running in his direction.
He felt the hot blood rushing to his face; he
experienced a feeling, too, somewhat akin to
anger—for his sharp ears had caught what
sounded suspiciously like bursts of hilarious
laughter.</p>

<p>And, to add to the boy’s discomfiture, he
caught sight of a “penguin,” wobbling and
shaking like a ship in a raging sea, approaching.
He had one brief, instantaneous glimpse
of a tremendously grinning face—that of
Dublin Dan’s—as the machine lurched swiftly
past. A short time later the foremost of the
crowd bore down upon him.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt, Don? Are you hurt?”
cried George Glenn, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“No—no!” jerked out Don.</p>

<p>And, as though these words were a signal
for a jollification to begin, roars of laughter
and howls of merriment broke loose on every
side. The students were not averse, it seemed,
to enjoying the humor of the situation.</p>

<p>“We have seen the human spinning-top!”
guffawed one.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful merry-go-round!”
gurgled another. “Sixty miles an hour without
budging an inch!”</p>

<p>“Say, boy, wasn’t that enough to make you
remember it?” chirped a third.</p>

<p>“You were chasing your tail so fast you
nearly caught up with it,” chimed in a fourth.
“At any rate, it’s certainly a case for the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Birds, even though it was a tough old
rooster.”</p>

<p>Now Don Hale, quite unsteady on his feet,
having a jumping throb in his forehead, and
being, besides, in a very disgusted state of
mind, could not, of course, enter into the
spirit of jollification, yet, nevertheless, by a
strong effort of the will, he managed to control
his tongue and temper.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you enjoyed the impromptu performance,
boys,” he said, pleasantly. “I
don’t believe I’ll ever be able to equal it again.
Ah——”</p>

<p>This “ah!” uttered with the most peculiar
intonation, was brought from his lips by the
mere fact of his eyes having caught those of
the moniteur.</p>

<p>But instead of the angry, steely expression
he had expected to see the boy was amazed to
observe that the Frenchman appeared as unconcerned
as though the incident was of the
most trivial character. Yet even this did not
take away the fear that he was in for a neat
little “bawling out.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur Hale, one sometimes learns
more by his mistakes than by his triumphs,”
were the words he heard, however. The instructor
spoke in genial tones. “Let us hope
that it will be true in this case! Come!—now
for another trial!”</p>

<p>Like a flash, Don Hale’s mood was changed;
his usual buoyancy reasserted itself, and he
was now as well able to laugh over his
adventure as any of the others. He also had
very grateful feelings toward the moniteur for
his forbearance.</p>

<p>“Dublin Dan’s ahead in the race so far!”
he exclaimed, laughingly, to his chum George
Glenn.</p>

<p>“Never mind! The day isn’t over yet,”
said George, with a smile.</p>

<p>Full of ardor, full of determination to retrieve
himself, the <span class='it'>élève</span> pilot took the lead in
marching back to the starting point.</p>

<p>There were always two things on the
practice field which well testified to the
hazardous nature of the work; a fleet of extra
“penguins” and an ambulance. One of the
former was very quickly rolled into place by
the assistants. And Don, his ears assailed by a
multitude of suggestions and words of advice,
climbed at once to his seat.</p>

<p>By this time numerous other “penguins,”
at widely separated points, were traveling
over the field. Number twelve, Dan’s machine,
could actually be seen racing toward
them on the home stretch; and in an incredibly
short space of time the dull gray
wings loomed up strongly against the turf.
Following a few extraordinary movements,
the machine stopped abruptly, and from the
occupant of the pilot’s seat there immediately
came a series of loud and boisterous hurrahs.</p>

<p>“Maybe I didn’t have a bully trip!”
he shouted. “Thought at first, though, I
couldn’t stop the engine, and that I’d have to
go clean around the whole earth and come
back again. But say, old stay-in-one-place, I
can almost feel, even now, the caressing
touches of those wind-blown clouds on my
cheeks.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s a great deal better than feeling
the caresses of the hard earth, as I did a
few moments ago,” laughed Don.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Allez, allez! En route!</span>”<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> commanded
the moniteur.</p>

<p>Don, experiencing the same measure of
confidence he had had before, though it was
now tempered by a much greater respect for
the difficulties of the task, waited expectantly.</p>

<p>“Now!” he breathed.</p>

<p>The blades were revolving; the engine
began its deafening roar—and, once more,
Don was flying over the turf as though hurled
from the mouth of a catapult. The new
pilot had learned his lesson well. He realized
that a firm though delicate movement of the
controls is necessary to assure safety and
success.</p>

<p>Faster, still faster, the “penguin” tore
ahead; and though its movements were far
from being smooth it kept to a comparatively
straight course, only occasionally displaying
an alarming tendency to turn over on its
face.</p>

<p>Almost breathless from the effects of the
violent wind which continually beat against
his face, and as jubilant as a few moments before
he had been in despair, Don Hale kept
his eyes fixed intently on the flag ahead; and
there grew in him a curious feeling that he
was being carried along by some wild, unruly
runaway. One moment the flag had appeared
dim and small in the distance; the next it
rose large and sharply defined.</p>

<p>The young pilot switched off the power, the
“penguin” began to diminish speed and after
running many yards beyond the goal stopped
its headlong flight.</p>

<p>That was certainly a proud moment to the
new candidate. The stain of his former defeat
was now entirely wiped away. He was
convinced that, after all, he had made an
auspicious beginning.</p>

<p>“Much good!” exclaimed one of the
Annamites, who was stationed in the field to
turn the machines around. “One grand
fly!”</p>

<p>“Thanks!” laughed Don. “And I’ll do
better next time.”</p>

<p>He was, however, to have his confidence a
little shaken on the return trip; for the
“bird,” apparently without any reason at all,
showed an almost irresistible tendency to fly
off at a tangent, first in one direction and
then another. And when this was finally
overcome it seemed to display an equally
ardent desire again to bury its nose in the
turf. Several times Don had alarming visions
of another inglorious smash.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, with the greatest feelings
of relief that he again brought the machine to
a stop.</p>

<p>And before this had been accomplished he
heard George Glenn shout:</p>

<p>“Great—great! Well done, old chap!”</p>

<p>“Surprised, George?” asked Don, gleefully,
when he could catch his breath.</p>

<p>“No; there are never any surprises on an
aviation field,” laughingly rejoined the other.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Vous avez fait de progres, mon ami</span>,”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a> commended
the moniteur. “Better take a few
moments’ rest before starting in again.”</p>

<p>Don Hale thought so, too. Naturally, he
hadn’t quite recovered from the effects of his
exhilarating experience. His pulse was beating
a trifle hard, and, unaccustomed to the
rushing wind which had beaten so relentlessly
upon him, there still remained some of its
effects.</p>

<p>“I’m in a better position now to appreciate
the feelings of Drugstore,” laughed Don to
a little knot gathered about him. “Honestly,
I think flying must be the greatest sport in
the world.”</p>

<p>“It’s certainly the highest,” chirped Tom
Dorsey.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the right idea, son,” chimed in
Gene Shannon. “Treat the old birds gently,
and you’ll soon be in a position to treat the
Boches rough.”</p>

<p>For a while Don was content to watch the
antics of the “penguins,” which were now
swarming over the field in great numbers,
and, as on every previous occasion, he found
plenty of thrills in the sight—collisions narrowly
averted and machines performing the
“chevaux de bois,” as the French say, which,
freely translated, means acting like a merry-go-round.</p>

<p>Some time later on he was off in the airplane
again, and shot forth and back across the
field a number of times, with generally fair
success, before taking another welcome rest.</p>

<p>Equally pleased over the afternoon’s work
was Dublin Dan; and he proclaimed his satisfaction
in a loud and boisterous manner.</p>

<p>“You won’t find me encouraging the scrap
heap industry,” he chuckled. “I’m going to
tear right through this course and hit the
next before I’m many days older.”</p>

<p>“Well, so long as you don’t hit me I’m satisfied,”
said Don, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Never mind. Don’t crow too soon,” interjected
the pessimistic Ben Holt. “You
chaps are a long way from the sky yet. It’s
pretty blue up there; and I’ve seen a few
fellows just as blue when they couldn’t make
it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see red if I don’t make it,” chirped
Dan.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Dublin Dan was taxiing
across the field, while Don leisurely prepared
to follow his example—in fact, so leisurely
that it was not until number twelve
was seen returning that he opened the throttle
and sent the “penguin” at full speed
ahead.</p>

<p>Ever mindful of the danger of collision,
the boy was particularly careful to give the
oncoming machine plenty of room, for, owing
to the tremendously high rate of speed at
which they were traveling, it would be only a
few moments before the machines were abreast
of one another.</p>

<p>Don Hale noticed that number twelve had
suddenly begun to act in the most wildly erratic
manner—so much so, indeed, as to suggest
that the pilot must have gone all to
pieces.</p>

<p>What was the matter? How did it happen
that the unusually promising pupil should
have lost control of his machine?</p>

<p>And while these thoughts were flashing
through his mind he suddenly became filled
with a chilling sense of dismay and fear; for
number twelve had deviated from its course
and was bearing down upon him in a zigzagging
line with almost the speed of a lightning express.</p>

<h1 id='chVII'>CHAPTER VII—THE VRILLE</h1>

<p>Uttering a half-inarticulate cry, the pilot
of number thirty-five made a supreme effort
to avert a catastrophe.</p>

<p>But, even as he did so, he realized, with a
sickening sensation of terror, that it would be
futile—that nothing he could do would be of
the slightest avail. With eyes staring wildly,
he had a quick vision of number twelve, as
though its sole purpose on earth was to run
him down, fairly hurling itself upon him.</p>

<p>Don Hale gave a loud yell, though the roar
of the motor drowned the sound. In a wild
panic, he attempted to rise. But the restraining
strap jerked him back to his seat. Then
he saw the frightened face of Dublin Dan
right before his eyes.</p>

<p>And that was the last thing they took in
for a moment. He found himself jerked high
in the air, then hurled violently forward.</p>

<p>The next instant his head struck the ground
with heavy force. A light seemed to flash before
his eyes, and, with the dull consciousness
that was still left to him, he heard supports,
struts and planes of both machines smashing
under the heavy blow. Blackness followed.</p>

<p>And then came a moment when he was
neither quite conscious of where he was or
what had happened. And when he presently
opened his eyes it was with the feelings of one
who has just awakened from a troubled, uneasy
slumber. The sound of excited voices
was ringing in his ears; he heard George
Glenn loudly calling his name, but he neither
answered nor stirred.</p>

<p>The latter was, of course, impossible. He
was pinned to the earth on every side by the
debris of the “penguin.”</p>

<p>As the boy’s faculties began to reassert
themselves a shudder ran through his frame,
and, for the first time, he became conscious of
the fact that every joint, every portion of his
body was racked with shooting pains. Had
he been seriously injured? In his apprehension,
he began to aid the rescuers in their
efforts to release both him and Dublin Dan.</p>

<p>The vigorous workers soon completed their
task, and Don felt strong arms on either side
dragging him to his feet. Some one was feeling
his pulse; some one was feeling his joints;
and some one laid a hand across his brow.</p>

<p>“Badly shaken up; suffering from shock;
not much injured, though,” he heard a voice
exclaim.</p>

<p>An instant before Don Hale’s vision had
seemed blurred—his consciousness strangely
dulled, but, somehow or other, the words
“suffering from shock” seemed to revive him
in an astonishing degree.</p>

<p>“‘Suffering from shock!’ Well, who
wouldn’t be?” he blurted out, almost angrily.
He gently pushed aside the supporting hands.
“I reckon, fellows, I don’t need any props
to support me. But say, how is Dublin
Dan?”</p>

<p>The young Irishman, surrounded by a
crowd, was lying in a half-reclining position
upon the turf, his usually florid face pale and
drawn. But as Don’s query reached his ears
he began to struggle up. It was a mighty
hard effort, however, bringing many an exclamation
of pain from his lips.</p>

<p>“Dublin Dan’s all right!” he exclaimed,
in a voice quite unlike his own. “But don’t
let me hear any one say I’m suffering from
shock, or I’ll paste ’em. Hey, boy, why
didn’t you get out of my way?”</p>

<p>“A comet couldn’t have gotten out of
your way,” retorted Don, smiling faintly.
“But why did you try to butt me off the
earth?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t do it. It was the ‘penguin,’”
said Dan. “I think I must have hurt the
old bird’s feelings by running over a bad
place in the ground; or else it got tired of
life and decided to quit. And that’s where
it isn’t like the Hagens. What train are you
going home on to-night?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to get a few more caressing
touches from the earth before I do that,” said
Don.</p>

<p>The boy was feeling very shaky; his
strength seemed to have so far deserted him
that it was with difficulty that he managed to
stand erect. The pains and aches he was
experiencing were so great as to still make
him wonder if, after all, he had not sustained
some injury which might keep him out of the
game for days—that was the only thought
bothering him now. Yet he was deeply thankful
that the terrific smash-up had had no
worse consequences.</p>

<p>Although it was a very important matter
to the two principals, the incident was so
trivial in the eyes of the older students of the
flying field that as soon as it was discovered
that neither of the boys was seriously injured
they began to retrace their steps.</p>

<p>The moniteur rather sternly demanded from
Dan Hagen an explanation of the cause of the
mishap.</p>

<p>“Tell him there isn’t any explanation,” said
Dan, when Don had translated the instructor’s
remarks. “It just happened—that’s all. I
reckon one of the great joys in this game is
that it keeps a chap so perpetually thankful
that he’s still alive that it makes up for everything
else. Say, Don, where do you feel the
worst?”</p>

<p>“All over,” replied Don.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t both of you better get back to the
barracks?” asked George Glenn, solicitously.</p>

<p>Don almost indignantly declined the suggestion.</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” he declared. “I’m going
to hang around here and watch the other
smash-ups.”</p>

<p>“And I’m not suffering from shock so much
that I can’t do the same,” said Dan, with a
grin.</p>

<p>Both Don and Dan soon found, however,
that they had been too much shaken up to
enter very thoroughly into the spirit of the
occasion. Nevertheless, they were of that
age when the very idea of retiring from the
field would have seemed like a deplorable surrender;
so they remained until the majority
of the pilots began their homeward march.</p>

<p>The boys were glad indeed to reach the
Hotel d’Amerique. They removed the dirt
and dust from their clothing and enjoyed a
refreshing wash; and their feelings were then
so far improved that each readily agreed to
accompany the crowd, after supper, to Étainville
and the club.</p>

<p>Thus the end of Don’s second day was
passed very much as the first. They found
Père Goubain, as usual, bubbling over with
good-nature, and listened to the bits of philosophy
which he expounded and to his tales
of spies with the same interest as on the night
before.</p>

<p>But there was something else which made
their visit to the Café Rochambeau far more
memorable than they had expected. While
the rattle of tongues was in progress every one
became aware of the fact that something was
going on in the village street. The air was
filled with the sounds of wheels jarring and
rumbling over the cobbled highway, the
steady tramping of horses’ hoofs and the
voices of men.</p>

<p>Don and George were the first to rush outside.
And what they saw gave them a thrill
of pleasure and of exultation.</p>

<p>Yes, yes! The Yanks were not only coming
but they had come. Actually!—an
American battery was making its way over
the lone street toward the front.</p>

<p>It was certainly a warlike scene over which
the magic rays of the brilliant moon were
playing. At the head of the procession rode
the captain, mounted on a big bay horse.
Close behind him followed the battery standard
bearer carrying the red guidon, which
lazily swayed to and fro. Silent and grim,
the two horsemen suggested knights of old
going forth to battle. Gun carriages and
caissons drawn by long teams of mettlesome
horses rattled and banged steadily past.</p>

<p>Now and again glinting lights flashed from
horses’ trappings, or from the sinister, wicked-looking
guns.</p>

<p>Often, from the wooden-shoed inhabitants
of the village—men, women and children,
who had flocked out into the street to view
the interesting spectacle, there came the cries
of, “Vive l’Amerique!” And to these salutations
officers, cannoneers and postilion
drivers sometimes responded with a “Vive la
France!”</p>

<p>“What a glorious sight!” exclaimed Père
Goubain, who, having managed to lift his
ponderous frame from the rocking-chair, had
joined the Americans outside.</p>

<p>“I reckon the Germans might as well fire
all their spies and give them respectable
jobs—eh, Père Goubain?” laughed Peur
Jamais.</p>

<p>The old innkeeper shook his head.</p>

<p>“As long as there are Germans there will
be spies,” he said, solemnly.</p>

<p>The crowd waited outside until the last
gun carriage had become lost to view and only
the faint sound of horses’ hoofs and grinding
wheels came over the silent air.</p>

<p>Then, as the hour was getting late, the boys
bade good-bye to Père Goubain and began
their tramp toward the barracks.</p>

<p>Arriving at the aviation field, the students
witnessed a spectacle which, to Don and Dublin
Dan at least, possessed a singular interest
and novelty. It was a dance executed by
Annamites and dark-skinned Arabian Zouaves
before several huge bonfires built in front of
their quarters. With the firelight playing
over the forms of the fantastically-moving
dancers and the weird, monotonous notes of
the native music, the scene was suggestive of
some far-off, uncivilized quarter of the globe.</p>

<p>“Those chaps are certainly working hard
for their fun,” remarked Dan Hagen.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see them get to fighting,
which they sometimes do,” laughed Cal Cummings.</p>

<p>“Excuse me the night the scrap comes off,”
chirped Don. “A little of that sort of thing
is much too much.”</p>

<p>“Like our smash-up to-day!” chuckled
Dublin Dan.</p>

<p>All the boys were pretty tired when they
reached the barracks; for training in the
flying school often produces a strain on the
nerves more fatiguing than hard work. No
time, therefore, was lost in turning in.</p>

<p>But Don Hale passed a most uncomfortable
and restless night. The pains and aches,
partially forgotten while in the midst of lively
scenes, now became violent enough to prevent
the boy from falling into the slumber which
nature craved—in fact he had not slept at all
when, after what seemed to be an interminable
length of time, the clear, musical
notes of the bugle, sounding the reveille,
broke in upon his ears.</p>

<p>It was a relief. But, at the same time, Don,
blinking-eyed and yawning, scarcely felt in
the mood to enjoy the work as he had done
on the day before. Out in the open air, however,
he soon felt more like himself, and his
natural enthusiasm soon overcame all bodily
fatigue.</p>

<p>The new <span class='it'>élève</span> imagined that he had conquered
the “penguin,” but the result of the
day’s performance, to his great surprise, and
equally great disgust, showed him that this
was merely an illusion. Both he and Dublin
Dan figured in several mishaps, the most
serious of which caused Dan’s “penguin” to
be towed to the repair shop. Both boys, too,
received a varied assortment of bruises. And
at night, when summing up the result of the
work, Don grimly declared that it certainly
was the end of an imperfect day.</p>

<p>A week passed, and then another, with Don
and Dan still struggling to obtain a complete
mastery over the unruly “birds.” There were
several interruptions in the work due to
thunder-storms. And after the artillery of
the clouds had ceased the rain continued for
hours. On such occasions the students
amused themselves by getting up impromptu
concerts; and sometimes, while the wind and
rain beat relentlessly against the Hotel
d’Amerique, the notes of such pleasing compositions
as Schumann’s “Traumerei,” Schubert’s
“Am Meer” and Mendelssohn’s “Spring
Song,” played on the piano by a former motion
picture artist, mingled with the ominous
blasts outside.</p>

<p>On certain days lectures were given; the
students were taught the theories of aeronautics
and the design and construction of various
types of flying machines. They were obliged,
too, to take motors apart and put them together
again. Then, there were courses in
map reading—a very important subject indeed
for the aviators must learn to keep
track of their aerial travels by such means.</p>

<p>About the middle of the third week Don
and Dan were delighted to be informed by
the instructor that their progress had been
sufficient to entitle them to enter the second
class. This did not mean that they were to
be allowed to fly. It did mean, however, that
they became pilots of real airplanes, though it
was not possible to turn on sufficient power
for the motors to take the machine off the
ground.</p>

<p>The boys found the sensation very different
from that experienced while trying to tame
the “penguins.” There was a delightful
lightness and buoyancy about these monoplanes,
as they skimmed over the ground,
exhilarating in the highest degree. They
continually seemed about to defy the
limitations set upon them and leave the terrestrial
globe for the firmament above.</p>

<p>And during all the time that Don and
Dan were wrestling with the new problems,
T. Singleton Albert, the former drugstore
clerk of Syracuse, was making the most
astonishing progress. Many in the beginning
had been accustomed to laugh at the
thought of the pale, anemic-looking chap
ever attaining his ambition of becoming an
airman, but, as Peur Jamais put it, he was
“leaving every one of them far behind.”</p>

<p>One evening, when the sun had long disappeared
beneath the horizon and the advance-guards
of approaching dusk were drawing
a veil over the distance and little by little
driving the color from objects near at hand,
a crowd of boys of the first and second
classes journeyed to the third flying field to
watch the machines circling around in the
sky.</p>

<p>“Won’t I be glad when I get to the real
work!” sighed Don.</p>

<p>Dave Cornwells, who was standing by, remarked:</p>

<p>“Boys, do you see that highest machine?
Well, the pilot is a certain daring young
aviator named T. Singleton Albert.”</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious!” exclaimed Dan
Hagen. “Why, that chap is certainly a
bird!”</p>

<p>“You’ve said something,” drawled Roy
Mittengale. “And he’ll never be satisfied
until he gets so high that the earth looks like
a rubber ball to him.”</p>

<p>As the shadows slowly deepened over the
earth the flyers, one by one, returned to the
<span class='it'>grande piste</span>.</p>

<p>There still remained one airplane high
aloft—so insignificant in the vast field of
graying sky that it seemed to lose all resemblance
to a flying machine and become but a
tiny, shapeless speck, so faint at times that
the naked eye could no longer follow its
varied evolutions. And every one on the
<span class='it'>grande piste</span> seemed to know to whom that
machine belonged—it was Albert’s.</p>

<p>“My, shan’t I be glad when I get into his
class!” commented Don Hale, whose face was
turned toward the sky.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, he gave voice to
a loud exclamation. Others did the same;
for the faint speck in the sky had suddenly
begun to behave in the most extraordinary
fashion. First it dove, then soared upward
again, not in the orderly fashion which one
might expect of a machine piloted by a skilled
aviator, but in a way which suggested that
something was amiss.</p>

<p>And this impression was strengthened a
few moments later when the machine began
to volplane at terrific speed, at the same time
swinging around and around as though on a
pivot.</p>

<p>“The vrille!<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> The vrille!” came from
dozens of excited students.</p>

<p>“The vrille!” echoed Don Hale, huskily.</p>

<h1 id='chVIII'>CHAPTER VIII—THE HERO</h1>

<p>The boy had heard about the “vrille,” and
he knew that it is one of the most difficult
evolutions an airman can perform, and that it
had sent many to their death.</p>

<p>For a few moments of tense and awe-stricken
silence the onlookers kept their gaze
fixed with agonized intentness upon the object
which, like a wounded bird, was tumbling
through space.</p>

<p>A sickening sensation of horror and despair
gripped the spectators. The airplane and its
pilot seemed doomed to utter annihilation.</p>

<p>Pale, trembling with apprehension, his
throat dry and husky, Don Hale could not
keep his eyes away from the spectacle of that
frightful fall. He stood as motionless as
though fastened to the turf by means of invisible
chains.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the still-revolving
plane. Now the machine was so clearly silhouetted
against the sky that even the supports
could be faintly distinguished.</p>

<p>Don had seen many a terrible sight during
his stay in the war zone, but perhaps none
had ever affected him so acutely as this. He
could not help picturing in his mind the
awful fate of poor Drugstore.</p>

<p>Not a voice—not an exclamation was heard.
That most awesome silence which sometimes
holds sway over spectators when they are
witnesses to a catastrophe which they are
powerless to avert had settled upon the
crowd.</p>

<p>Faces were beginning to be turned aside,
and though Don Hale felt an almost irresistible
impulse to do the same, an impulse still
stronger kept his wide, staring eyes fixed upon
the airplane.</p>

<p>But a few moments more, and the tragedy
would be over. His nerves were quivering
violently. The strain of those few terrible
seconds was almost too hard to bear.</p>

<p>And then, just as he was preparing to steel
himself for the sound of a sickening crash—for
the sight of a machine, smashed and
battered to pieces, bursting into flames—a wild,
half-stifled cry escaped his lips.</p>

<p>What was the reason?</p>

<p>Because of an almost unbelievable, impossible
happening.</p>

<p>The airplane had suddenly stopped its
whirling evolutions, and was soaring majestically
through the air not a hundred feet above
their heads. Its engine had started and was
sending a deep droning hum through the air.</p>

<p>It took a few seconds for the strange and
oppressive silence to be broken. It was as
though the enthralled witnesses of the scene
could not at first comprehend the evidences of
their vision. Then frantic shouts and wild
cheers rang forth over and over again.</p>

<p>Actually!—Drugstore was safe. What
did it mean? Had he become such a master
aviator that he had been simply giving an exhibition
of his skill? It looked that way.</p>

<p>In their joy, the students slapped each
other on the shoulder and yelled themselves
hoarse.</p>

<p>Around and around the <span class='it'>-piste</span> flew the airplane,
and it was not until a certain calmness
had been restored among the students that it
volplaned swiftly toward the earth, and, as
easily as a bird alighting, struck the ground
and presently came to a halt.</p>

<p>And the moment it had done so an excited
crowd began rushing toward it from different
parts of the field.</p>

<p>No conquering hero was ever acclaimed
with greater fervor—with greater enthusiasm
than T. Singleton Albert. Hands were thrust
forward to shake that of the returned
aviator.</p>

<p>The moniteurs praised and chided him at
the same time. It was almost unbelievable,
one of them declared, that a student with so
little experience should have possessed sufficient
courage to execute such a dangerous and
daring maneuver.</p>

<p>And throughout it all Albert remained
quite silent. The demonstration, indeed,
seemed to embarrass him—to bring his
natural modesty and reserve all the more to
the front.</p>

<p>“Simply splendid, T. Singleton!” cried
Don, enthusiastically. “Only, I wish to
goodness you had notified us beforehand
what was coming off. Honestly, my nerves
are jumping like a jack-in-the-box. But
didn’t the vrille make you dizzy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted Drugstore—“so much
so that just now I wouldn’t be able to look in
a mirror and see myself twice in the same
place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you’ll have any occasion to
fear Captain Baron Von Richtofen and his
Red Squadron of Death,” chuckled Marlow.
“If they ever get after you, son, just pull off
the same trick, and it’ll mean a safe getaway.”</p>

<p>Albert clambered out of the machine, and,
as though wishing to escape further attention,
hurried rather unsteadily toward a camion
standing by the side of the field. But such a
sensational and unexpected event was not to
be dismissed in so unceremonious a fashion.
All the way to the waiting vehicle the former
soda-water dispenser was obliged to listen to
enthusiastic comments and reply to numerous
queries.</p>

<p>And so it continued all the way to the
Hotel d’Amerique, and even at the supper
table later on.</p>

<p>Then it was that Sid Marlow started
other demonstration, by exclaiming, in his
big, booming voice:</p>

<p>“Sometimes a chap has no right to be
modest. I’ve traveled over some pretty rough
trails, fellows, and early discovered that modesty
is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in
the path of success. That’s the reason I
haven’t any.”</p>

<p>“We’ve noticed it,” chirped Roy Mittengale.</p>

<p>“You’ll notice it some more, too, when I
equal Albert’s record. Now, boys, I call upon
our young friend for a speech. Who seconds
the motion?”</p>

<p>Everybody did, and with an enthusiasm
which brought warm flushes to the face of the
embarrassed Albert.</p>

<p>He tried to resist, too, when those nearest
at hand forced him to his feet. This time,
however, the crowd was determined. They
brushed aside the boy’s protestations, and
presently Drugstore, finding that there was
absolutely no chance to escape the trying
ordeal, began to make a few stammering remarks.</p>

<p>For a moment the eyes of all in the room
fixed intently upon him threatened to stop
altogether his halting words. And then, suddenly,
to the surprise of all, he collected his
scattered wits and pulled himself together.
It was as if a new spirit had entered into him.
The flush left his cheeks and the tremolo in
his voice was replaced by a firm and even tone.</p>

<p>But the first words he uttered when this
changed condition had taken possession of
him fairly astounded his hearers.</p>

<p>“Boys, I’m through with flying forever.”</p>

<p>“Through with flying forever!” cried Don.</p>

<p>Then came an almost riotous demand for
explanations. The boys weren’t going to
stand for any “joshing.” But, as cool and
collected as before he had been the reverse,
Albert voiced his declaration a second time.</p>

<p>“True as I’m standing here, boys, I mean
it,” he declared. “I’m no hero. That wasn’t
a joy ride to show what I could do in the way
of handling the plane—oh, no! It was nearer
to being a real tragedy. And I’m through
with the game for all time.”</p>

<p>Drugstore’s assertions created another sensation.
A babel of tongues prevented his
next words from being heard.</p>

<p>Big Sid Marlow quickly restored silence.</p>

<p>“Now tell us all about it, Albert,” he commanded.</p>

<p>“It’s a mighty short story,” replied Drugstore.
“I made up my mind to do the vrille,
but somehow or other, at the very last moment,
the idea of actually starting it had such
an effect upon my nerves that I decided to
leave it for another time. Even the thought,
high up there in the air, was enough to send
cold chills creeping through me and make me
perform some bungling movements with the
controls. Before I could regain the mastery
over myself, almost before I could realize it,
my plane was thrown into the vrille and I
was shooting through space, with the machine
absolutely out of control.” Albert’s voice
faltered. An intense agitation seemed to grip
him. “It was terrible—frightful!” He almost
gasped. “Never had I the least expectation
of coming through it alive. Never
shall I forget those terrifying moments—the
agony I suffered. That one experience, fellows,
has taken away all the fascination of the
game. Call it a yellow streak if you want;
call it a case of downright cowardice—I can’t
help that. I’m going to quit the flying school
for good.”</p>

<p>And having uttered these words with a
conviction which permitted no one to doubt
his absolute sincerity, T. Singleton Albert
abruptly turned away and made for the door.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Don Hale, “that chap
may not think he’s a hero, but, all the same,
I believe he is.”</p>

<p>And to this sentiment every one heartily
agreed.</p>

<h1 id='chIX'>CHAPTER IX—THE ACE</h1>

<p>Many of the students confidently believed
that by the time another day had rolled
around Albert would have so far recovered
from the effects of his thrilling experience as
to reconsider his determination. This, however,
was not the case.</p>

<p>A few privately expressed the opinion that
Drugstore was a quitter, but, somehow or
other, the boy’s frank avowal had raised him
in the opinion of the majority, who sincerely
regretted that so promising a pupil should be
lost to the school.</p>

<p>During the late afternoon another American
arrived. Of course this was not a very important
event. Students were always going and
coming, some leaving for
the <span class='it'>École de Perfectionment</span><a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a>
others being sent back to their
regiments when it was found that they were not
fitted by nature to become successful airmen.</p>

<p>But a little incident in connection with the
appearance of the newcomer profoundly interested
those of an observant or inquisitive
nature. It was a rather dramatic meeting between
him and the former college student,
Victor Gilbert.</p>

<p>The latter, who was now in the third class
and gave promise of being one of the best of
the <span class='it'>élève</span> pilots, upon entering the room and
coming face to face with the other halted as
though almost petrified with astonishment,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Hello! You here, Jason Hamlin!”
Whereupon the other answered, in a tone
which showed no trace of friendliness:</p>

<p>“Yes, I am here, Gilbert. And one of the
reasons I am here is because you are here.
Does that disturb you?”</p>

<p>“Not enough for me to notice it,” returned
Victor Gilbert, coolly.</p>

<p>“Flying is a dangerous game, eh?”</p>

<p>“There are other games just as dangerous.”</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-120.jpg' alt='' id='illus-120'/>
<p class='caption'>“There are other games just as dangerous”</p>
</div>

<p>At this remark Jason Hamlin’s face flushed
perceptibly; his fingers twitched; a steely
glare which plainly told of a spirit moved to
anger came into his eyes.</p>

<p>But the interesting colloquy ended there.</p>

<p>“I say, wasn’t that mighty curious about
Gilbert and Hamlin?” exclaimed Bobby
Dunlap, otherwise Peur Jamais, to Don
Hale, after the evening meal was over. “I
wonder what Gilbert meant by saying: ‘There
are other games just as dangerous.’”</p>

<p>“It’s too much of a riddle for me.”</p>

<p>“I tried to pump this Jason person a little,”
declared Peur Jamais, “but he was as dry
as an old well gone out of business. Strikes
me there’s a little mystery which I’ll have to
unravel.”</p>

<p>“I’ll let you have all the fun of the unraveling,”
chortled Don. “Go to it, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes the second.”</p>

<p>“All right!” chirped Bobby. “I hope I
shan’t get a punch in the eye while I’m
sherlocking. Our friend Jason looks as
though he wouldn’t have much trouble in
finding his temper.”</p>

<p>“Or losing it,” said Don, with a laugh.
“But say, Bobby, I got a letter to-day from
George Glenn. And what do you think he’s
seen?”</p>

<p>“Break it to me gently.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Don Hale drew from his pocket
the missive, and began to read:</p>

<p>“‘To-day I had a mighty exciting experience.
It was during my two hours’ patrol
over the enemy’s line, and the “Archies”
were following my plane thick and fast.’”</p>

<p>“The ‘Archies’! What does he mean by
‘Archies’?” interrupted Bobby.</p>

<p>“It’s a name the flying fighters have
given to the anti-aircraft guns,” replied Don.
“Though I reckon no one knows exactly the
reason why.”</p>

<p>He resumed:</p>

<p>“‘Don, I must confess that this afternoon
I got a pretty big scare. I was just about to
return to the encampment of the squadron
when I saw something that made my pulse
throb as it hasn’t throbbed even when I was
engaged in a duel in the air. It was the sight
of two crimson planes swooping down upon
me from above—a part of Captain Baron Von
Richtofen’s Red Squadron!’”</p>

<p>“Great Caesar’s bald-headed nanny-goat!”
ejaculated Bobby. “Where’s my suit-case?
I think I’ll go home with Drugstore.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t blame you,” laughed Don.</p>

<p>“‘By the time I made this startling discovery
the foremost had opened fire with his
machine gun. And the first thing I knew
bullets were ripping through my plane.’”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’ll wait for my suitcase,
after all!” exclaimed Peur Jamais.
“Whew! What did George do to them for
that?”</p>

<p>“The next chapter is as follows,” said
Don:</p>

<p>“‘I threw my plane into the vrille, and the
next shots sped over my head. That might
not have saved me, either, had it not been
that some of the boys, seeing my predicament,
literally sailed into the Germans.’”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” cried Bobby. “By this
time I really ought to be half-way to the
station.”</p>

<p>Don continued:</p>

<p>“‘From now on I expect things to be more
dangerous than usual, which is saying a good
bit. I will write again soon if—though I
will say au revoir.’”</p>

<p>“I can’t say the prospect looks so very
enchanting,” confessed Bobby. “But, as the
French say, ‘C’est la guerre!’ And that
means it isn’t any pink tea affair, eh?”</p>

<p>“I guess not; though I never drank any
pink tea,” laughed Don.</p>

<p>Some time later T. Singleton Albert approached
the two.</p>

<p>“I thought I’d say good-bye, fellows,” he
announced. “I’m leaving during the forenoon
to-morrow, and you chaps might not
happen to be around.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad!” said Don. “I suppose it’s
no use of our saying a word, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” declared the other, very
emphatically. “That tumble in the air
certainly did the business for me. Why, do
you know, even the very sight of an airplane
going aloft gives me the queerest kind of feelings.
Take my advice—be a bit slow in
making haste. Then you won’t have to pack
your suit-cases and get out, as I’m doing.”</p>

<p>Albert spoke in the tone of one who felt
that his ambitions had been rudely shattered—that
the future held no hope.</p>

<p>The daring young airman who had
astonished the students by his rapid progress had
become once more the drugstore clerk, the
very antithesis of what an airman might be
expected to appear.</p>

<p>Drugstore solemnly wished them the best
luck in the world, hoped they might win
fame and glory in the sky, and then, after
shaking hands very heartily, wandered away
to say his adieus to the others.</p>

<p>“I think, after all, the soda-water counter is
his proper sphere in life,” remarked Dunlap,
presently. “He’s more fitted to be reading
about the exploits of other chaps than trying
to do them himself.”</p>

<p>“I hope the weather is all right to-morrow,”
broke in Don. “It was looking a bit threatening
when we came in—all clouded over.
Let’s take a look outside, ‘Fear Never.’”</p>

<p>“All right,” chirped Bobby. “Goodness,
how I hate rainy days! I think I know,
now, how a chicken in a coop must feel.”</p>

<p>The two walked outside the crowded barracks,
and both at once gave voice to expressions
indicative of disappointment.</p>

<p>The entire heavens was covered with a
thick canopy of clouds.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Druggy need have said
good-bye to-night,” remarked Peur Jamais,
disconsolately. “If I issued a Weather Communique
it would sound something like this:
High and steady winds; heavy rains, with
no intermissions between; lightning and
thunder in equal proportions; life-boats and
rafts in demand.’”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” sighed Don. “There are
other days ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t think there were I’d never be
standing here as calmly as this,” returned
Bobby, laughingly. “Let’s go back to the
smell of kerosene and dismal light.”</p>

<p>It was rather late when the crowd turned
in; and the last one hadn’t been asleep
very long before pattering drops of rain were
heard falling upon the roof, while the wind,
in soft and musical cadences, kept steadily
blowing.</p>

<p>About two <span class='sc'>a. m.</span> there came a veritable
downpour and big, booming reverberations of
thunder. Vivid flashes of bluish lightning
filled each window with a dazzling glare and
cast a weird and uncanny light throughout
the room.</p>

<p>“It’s a wild night, all right,” exclaimed
Dublin Dan, half sitting up.</p>

<p>“It means no flying to-morrow,” grumbled
Mittengale.</p>

<p>“Such little trials have their usefulness.”
It was Victor Gilbert who spoke. “It teaches,
or rather, should teach one to be philosophical
and accept the inevitable with resignation.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be philosophical,” complained
Peur Jamais. “And I won’t be
philosophical, either. Whew! Some big
waste of electric light, that!”</p>

<p>No one made any reply, or if they did it
was unheard; for the most appalling detonation
shook and rattled the barracks. It
seemed as if the structure must be shaken
from its very foundations.</p>

<p>And thus the storm continued until the
boys were routed from their beds by the musical
notes of the bugle.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark and gloomy. The wind
tore past with no soft and musical cadences
mingled in with its angry whistling, and now
and again a flurry of raindrops splattered
noisily down.</p>

<p>The usual roll call was held, and then the
boys were free to do as they pleased. Don
Hale concluded to take a nap in his former
place between the sheets.</p>

<p>When he once more opened his eyes the
morning was well advanced.</p>

<p>Jumping out of his berth, with an exclamation
of surprise, the boy hastily slipped on his
clothes and walked outside.</p>

<p>Scarcely a hint of color could be seen in the
landscape. Here and there pools had formed,
reflecting the dull, leaden gray of the wind-driven
clouds, the air was filled with moisture,
and the dull and heavy-looking earth
seemed to have absorbed all it could possibly
hold.</p>

<p>Gazing at the landscape was not a particularly
enjoyable pastime; so the boy reentered
the barracks.</p>

<p>An hour passed, during which the crowd
amused itself in various ways. Then a shout
outside was heard. Although the words
themselves were not understood, it was a call
so clearly intended to bring the boys that a
general stampede for the door was made.</p>

<p>And when they reached it, they perceived a
biplane which, in utter defiance of the treacherous
wind buffeting it about, was approaching
the aviation grounds at tremendous speed,
its graceful, rocking form outlined in lightish
tones against the sinister-looking storm-clouds.</p>

<p>“I believe he’s going to land!” cried Don.</p>

<p>“Of course. Did you think he was condemned
to fly forever!” chirped Dublin
Dan.</p>

<p>Now the loud, droning hum of the motors
and propellers, which had been filling the air,
suddenly ceased, and the object darting swiftly
through the sky began to volplane in graceful
spirals toward the earth.</p>

<p>Realizing that the biplane, which all now
recognized as a Nieuport machine, an <span class='it'>avion de
chasse</span>, as the French call them, would alight
some distance away, the crowd started running
over the muddy field toward it.</p>

<p>And while they were on the way the pilot
made the most perfect <span class='it'>atterrissage</span><a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> any of
them had ever seen.</p>

<p>T. Singleton Albert, who had not yet left,
was enthusiastic in his praise.</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, wasn’t that jolly fine!” he cried.
“And——”</p>

<p>He got no further; for just then some one
bawled out with much gusto and boisterousness:</p>

<p>“It’s a machine belonging to the Lafayette
Squadron!”</p>

<p>“The Lafayette Squadron!” echoed a number
of others, the rather shrill and falsetto
voice of Drugstore being plainly heard.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the insignia of the famous
flying squadron—the face of an Indian warrior,
now faded and worn by the rains and
snows which had beaten upon it, could be
clearly distinguished on the body of the
rakish-looking plane.</p>

<p>Don Hale forgot all about the dreary
prospect ahead of him for the day in his
absorbed contemplation of the visiting biplane.
Then his glances fell upon the aviator just on
the point of stepping from the nacelle, or
cockpit.</p>

<p>“Hello!”</p>

<p>He uttered the word aloud and excitedly.</p>

<p>The appearance of the aviator was thoroughly
familiar. He had seen pictures of
him many a time. A curious thrill shot
through the boy; for suddenly he realized
that he was looking upon William Thaw, the
famous American Ace, one of the most commanding
figures of the Franco-American Flying
Corps.</p>

<p>Others, too, among the crowd had recognized
the renowned aviator, and a burst of
enthusiastic cheering ending in a “Rah, rah,
for Thaw!” rang out.</p>

<p>The famous ace smilingly bowed his acknowledgments,
remarking:</p>

<p>“Many thanks, fellows! I thought I would
just take a flyer over here to pay a brief visit
to my old friend, the commandant.”</p>

<p>“But—but—you didn’t actually come all
the way from the front, Lieutenant Thaw,
did you?” almost stuttered T. Singleton
Albert, whose eyes were fixed with strange
intensity on the trim, though mud-bespattered
little Nieuport.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Had quite a scrap, too, just before
leaving. Did I get the Boche?” Lieutenant
Thaw smiled genially. “No. I think
that particular Teuton must have had faith in
the old adage that ‘He who fights and runs
away may live to fight another day.’ Now,
boys, I suppose it’s quite safe for me to leave
the machine here until I return?”</p>

<p>Being assured that it was, the aviator, with
a wave of his hand, started trudging through
the soggy field toward the commandant’s office.</p>

<p>By this time Don Hale and Albert were
making a close examination of the Nieuport.
Both took a look at the cockpit, beautifully
finished in hard wood, and at the upholstered
pilot’s seat, and studied the brightly-shining
nickel-plated instruments which tell the pilot
practically everything he needs to know while
in the air.</p>

<p>There was something else, too,—an ominous-looking
something else—which attracted and
held their interest—a Vickers machine gun,
the firing of which is so perfectly timed that
the bullets fly between the whirling propeller
blades.</p>

<p>To Don Hale, and, doubtless, to many
others, that weapon, catching and reflecting
numerous gleams of light, was almost awe-inspiring.
And, to add to these feelings, they
presently discovered several bullet holes in
both the upper and lower planes, silent and
eloquent testimonials of the perils which always
face the intrepid and courageous fighters
of the air.</p>

<p>At first Albert had been quite talkative—that
is for him; then, as he walked around
the machine, studying every detail with the
same interest that a connoisseur might have
displayed in the contemplation of a rare and
priceless piece of statuary, he suddenly became
silent. Finally his mild, unassuming
air deserted him, and, straightening up, he
exclaimed, loudly:</p>

<p>“Fellows, I’ve changed my mind. Nobody
is ever going to call me a quitter. I’m not
going to leave the school after all. No, sir!
I’ll keep at the flying game; and, by George,
I’ll get to the front, too.”</p>

<p>Following his sudden and almost vehement
outburst, there came a silence.</p>

<p>But it was quickly broken. And as loud
as had been the cheering for the visiting
aviator it distinctly held second place to that
which greeted T. Singleton Albert’s unexpected
declaration.</p>

<p>The boys shook his hand and slapped him
delightedly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Julius Cæsar! The Germans are going to
pay dearly on account of this unexpected visit
of Lieutenant William Thaw,” cried Roy Mittengale.</p>

<p>“Poor Baron Von Richtofen and his Red
Squadron of Death!” laughed Bobby Dunlap.
“Just think of all those gallons of red paint
gone to waste! Drugstore, your nerve is
simply grand!”</p>

<p>A little later, when the American lieutenant
returned, the students told him about the
incident, whereupon he, too, heartily congratulated
Albert.</p>

<p>“We need young chaps like you at the
front,” he declared. “The air service is of
the greatest importance. It has been called
the ‘Eyes of the Army.’ The game, too, is
wonderfully thrilling—wonderfully interesting.
Let me wish you much glory, success—and
safety.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he climbed into the cockpit.</p>

<p>Don Hale gave the propeller a whirl and,
presently, amid a chorus of good-byes, the
Nieuport started off. Faster and faster it
moved over the field, sending streams of mud
and water flying in every direction, and, at
last, gaining sufficient momentum, it glided
into the air.</p>

<p>The crowd watched the biplane until it had
disappeared in the murky, moisture-laden air.</p>

<p>“Boys, I’ll never forget this day,” declared
Drugstore. “It’s strange how little things
may alter the whole course of a person’s
life!”</p>

<p>And every one, quite as solemnly, agreed
with him that it was.</p>

<h1 id='chX'>CHAPTER X—CORPORAL DON</h1>

<p>Not long after this there came another very
interesting day in Don Hale’s life. He had
graduated from the first and second classes
and was to make his first flight in the air.</p>

<p>Only those who have gone through a similar
experience can understand Don Hale’s feelings
when he seated himself in the cockpit of
a much-used though sturdy little plane and
laid hold of the controls. No veteran airman
or famous “ace”<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a> could possibly have felt
more exultant or proud.</p>

<p>The school by this time had become very
full, and many of the <span class='it'>élèves</span> were obliged to
await their turn; so there were always plenty
of spectators on the field; and these generally
paid particular attention to the boys who were
making their first trial spin in the air. This
all added to Don Hale’s tremendous desire to
make a good showing; for he still had vivid
recollections of his preliminary experiences
with the “penguins.”</p>

<p>“Now, remember, make no attempt to turn
in the air,” commanded the moniteur in
charge. “Perfectly straight flights only; fly
no higher than thirty feet above the ground.”</p>

<p>“Get out your tape-measure, Donny,” giggled
Roy Mittengale. “Remember, every foot
adds to the jolt of the fall at the bottom.”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to imitate Lieutenant Thaw so
much that you’ll hurt yourself,” advised Ben
Holt.</p>

<p>“Safety first in airplanes means not to go
up at all,” chimed in another.</p>

<p>Don, however, wasn’t paying the slightest
attention to these jocular remarks, for the
mechanic had his hand on the propeller.</p>

<p>It certainly was a wonderful sensation to
the young airman when he felt the machine
suddenly begin to move, slowly at first, but
rapidly gathering momentum, until, like a
high power motor car, it was racing at a speed
which made him almost gasp for breath.</p>

<p>Presently the boy gritted his teeth together,
and, with a peculiar feeling suggestive of
I-wonder-what-is-going-to-happen-next state
of mind, pulled back gently on the control
stick.</p>

<p>And then, abruptly, he realized that the
monoplane was traveling ahead with a most
wonderful smoothness. The wind rushed
past, lashing and stinging his face with its
terrific force, but the heavy goggles prevented
his eyes from being affected.</p>

<p>Don Hale glanced over the side of the cockpit,
and, a little to his dismay, discovered that
he was just skimming a few feet above the
surface of the earth.</p>

<p>A quick pull on the control stick sent the
monoplane racing aloft, and before the boy,
trembling with excitement, could bring it to
an even keel he was far above the height
limit set by the instructor.</p>

<p>At first Don Hale had been acutely nervous—even
fearful and apprehensive. To him it
was a very marvelous thing to be actually off
the earth, the pilot of a real flying machine.
And it scarcely seemed possible that the machine
should require so little attention. Like
a flash, all the unpleasant feelings that had
disturbed him vanished.</p>

<p>Jubilant, exultant, almost ready to shout
with the sheer joy of the exhilarating sensations
he was experiencing, Don Hale once
more looked earthward. How strange the
ground looked flying beneath him at incredible
speed! How high above it he appeared
to be! If anything should happen to his
machine a fall from that height might produce
most serious results.</p>

<p>With one swift, comprehensive glance, his
eyes took in the boys at various points on the
field and the planes which, for one reason or
another, were resting here and there on the
turf. Then his greatest desire and ambition
in the world was to descend—to return to that
haven of safety.</p>

<p>Yes, flying was easy enough; but when it
came to making a landing—that was where
the difficulty began.</p>

<p>Nervously, Don switched off the current
and pushed the control stick forward.</p>

<p>And, to his utter dismay, the plane seemed
to be falling headlong at an acute angle—the
ground to be fairly shooting up toward him.</p>

<p>For one brief instant he had a terrible
vision of a fatal smash-up. Then, a pull of
the lever in the opposite direction brought
the nose of the machine upward again. And
following this, to the boy’s intense surprise
and relief, the monoplane dropped in the most
gentle fashion to terra firma, taxi-ing across
the field, its speed rapidly diminishing.</p>

<p>When it had come to a stop Don found his
face bathed in perspiration and his pulse
throbbing in a way that it had seldom done
before.</p>

<p>“By George! Am I actually here!” he
muttered.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that the boy had
made a mighty good landing and could hear
shouts of approval coming from the distance
he was too honest with himself to be gratified
with the achievement. He knew that it was
simply a case of good luck.</p>

<p>“But just wait till next time!” he muttered,
grimly. “By George, the earth never
seemed so fine before!”</p>

<p>A number of Annamites presently appeared
and turned the machine around.</p>

<p>It was not for some time, however, that
Don’s nerves quieted down sufficiently for
him to put his airplane into motion. With a
fervent hope that fate would be as kind to
him as it had been before, he switched on the
ignition and once again faced the blasts of
wind.</p>

<p>Then came the delicious moment of soaring
upward—the ecstasy of feeling himself borne
through the air as swiftly as the arrow from
an archer’s bow and that sense of wonderful
freedom which the airman alone can enjoy.</p>

<p>As before, he glanced downward, and a
humorous thought came into his mind.</p>

<p>“Certainly I’m the biggest thirty feet that
was ever known above the ground,” he murmured.
“I hope I don’t fly to the moon.”</p>

<p>With astonishing rapidity the distant
hangars, from hazy, indistinct objects, became
strong and clear. He could see the students
and instructors, watching, it seemed to him,
with an interest and close attention that fired
his spirit with the keenest determination to
make a landing that would surprise them.</p>

<p>He did.</p>

<p>But the machine was not badly wrecked,
nor was he himself injured by the fall of
fifteen feet.</p>

<p>It was merely a case, Mittengale genially
explained, in which the earth happened to be
that many feet lower than it should have
been.</p>

<p>Don said very little. It rather jarred his
sensibilities to hear the mirthful laughter and
bantering remarks and to see the Annamites
towing an extraordinarily wobbling machine
toward the repair shop. And, besides this, to
add to his disturbed state of mind, the moniteur,
a boyish chap named Boulanger, very
loudly called attention to the error which had
caused the accident, between times roundly
scolding him.</p>

<p>“Quite a neat little bawling out!” chirped
Dublin Dan, soothingly. “It’s a great life if
you don’t weaken.”</p>

<p>“I don’t include that word in my vocabulary,”
exclaimed Don, with a half smile.</p>

<p>But though Don Hale’s start in the third
class had not been particularly auspicious,
nevertheless, by the end of the day he managed
to gain sufficient mastery over the plane
to receive a “<span class='it'>Pas mal</span>, Hale!”—“Not bad!”
from the same moniteur who had chided him.</p>

<p>That evening, while lying in his bunk, he
summed up the situation in regard to himself.
There were other pupils who had made faster
progress, but the boy felt sure that what he
had learned he had thoroughly learned. He
knew, however, that there was a tremendous
amount of work ahead of him before he could
possibly hope to equal the skill of the most
humble flyer of the Lafayette Squadron—a
squadron which he devoutly hoped to join.</p>

<p>Difficulties have the effect on some natures
of spurring them to greater zeal and determination;
so it was in the case of Don Hale.
Each failure, each “bawling out,” each chorus
of laughter only acted as a stimulus.</p>

<p>In a little less than a week he had acquired
sufficient skill in driving the machine in
straight courses across the field to be promoted
another step—that is to the <span class='it'>tour de piste</span>, or
tour of the aviation field at a height of about
three hundred feet.</p>

<p>This was, of course, designed to teach the
airmen how to make their turns in the air, an
operation requiring the greatest accuracy and
care. Up to this time Don thought he had
enjoyed about all the thrills that it was possible
to have, but the first <span class='it'>tour de piste</span> undeceived
him. All the other experiences faded
into insignificance when compared to this.
In his splendid isolation from all mankind,
he was filled with a certain sense of awe a
little unnerving at first. He was in a situation
where no power save his own could be of
any avail, and on the first two or three occasions
involuntary tremors shook his frame as
the Bleriot monoplane banked, or swung
around at an angle.</p>

<p>Happily, however, there was no tragedy to
record. With increasing confidence, Don
dared to rise higher, and within a few hours
had reached the required altitude. From this
elevation he viewed with absorbed attention
the wonderful panorama, which, like a colored
map, was outspread before him, revealing
fields of various forms, shapes and colors, and
patches of woods and hills. And dividing
the landscape were light lines—the roads—running
in all directions.</p>

<p>His first tour was satisfactory to himself and
his instructors. The turns held no terror for
him.</p>

<p>Following this several days of bad weather
put a stop to the work of the school. During
the enforced inactivity Bobby Dunlap had his
curiosity and interest in Victor Gilbert and
Jason Hamlin still further heightened by a
violent altercation between the two, although
neither he nor any one else was near enough
to overhear the conversation. The fact, too,
that the young chaps had evidently been just
on the point of indulging in a physical encounter
made the “Gilbert-Hamlin affair,” as
Bobby termed it, decidedly interesting.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find out all about it some
day,” he laughed, nodding his head emphatically.</p>

<p>“Bully boy!” chuckled Sid Marlow.</p>

<p>When the period of dull weather was over
Don Hale started in with greater zeal than
ever. He was doing his best to equal the
record of T. Singleton Albert, who had so far
recovered his nerve that he had no hesitancy
at all in executing the vrille.</p>

<p>By gradual degrees, Don took his machine
to greater altitudes, until, at length, he was
making the <span class='it'>tour de piste</span> at a height of three
thousand five hundred feet. Now feeling
somewhat like a veteran, he was fully prepared
when the order came for him to perform some
of the simpler evolutions in the air. One of
these consisted in spiraling down to the earth
with the engine shut off and landing almost
directly beneath the point at which he started.
Another was to volplane swiftly downward,
and then, while still several hundred feet in
the air, bring the machine to a horizontal
position and swing around either to the right
or left.</p>

<p>These exercises proved to be a pretty severe
test on his nerves, and at first affected his head
and stomach in a truly distressing manner;
but constant practice, combined with a determined
will, finally enabled him to gain the
mastery over them, and he began keenly to
enjoy the great and thrilling swoops through
space.</p>

<p>At length there came a time to which he
had been looking forward most anxiously, and
that was the beginning of his training in a
big Caudron biplane, a rather slow but safe
machine. This meant that Don Hale’s stay
at the École Militaire de Beaumont was nearly
at an end.</p>

<p>There were now but two tests before him,
one known as the <span class='it'>petit voyage</span> and the other
the <span class='it'>grande voyage</span>. The first was a sixty mile
trip and return; the second a triangular
journey, each side being about seventy miles
in length.</p>

<p>By the time Don had passed these successfully
T. Singleton Albert and Victor Gilbert
had gone to the great finishing school located
at Pau, in the southern part of France.</p>

<p>It was indeed a happy moment to Don
when he received his “<span class='it'>Brevet d’Aviateur
Militaire</span>” from the War Department, which made
him a corporal in the French army. This
merely meant, however, that he had graduated
from the school at Beaumont, and, like
the two who had preceded him, was sent to
take a course in “acrobatics” at Pau.</p>

<p>Pau, he found, was very delightfully situated,
and within sight of the snow-capped
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>With even added zest, Don Hale entered
into the work before him. It was more dangerous
than anything he had attempted in the
school at Beaumont; but the tactics he learned
were of extreme importance, being precisely
those used in air fighting on the front.</p>

<p>About the middle of his course Don Hale
was ordered to report to the Mitrailleuse
school at Casso, on the shore of a lake, where
soldiers in all branches of the army are
trained in the use of machine guns. In a
two-seater, piloted by another airman, Don
Hale practiced firing at captive balloons and
moving targets on the lake.</p>

<p>At first it proved very difficult, but constant
work soon enabled him to meet the requirements
of his instructors.</p>

<p>After the completion of this training he returned
to Pau for a short period. Following
this he went to Plessis Belleville to add a few
final touches before being assigned to combat
duty in one of the escadrilles.</p>

<p>The boy’s greatest ambition was to join the
Lafayette, where he might be near his chum
George Glenn, and he passed through a period
of much anxiety before the matter was finally
settled in the affirmative by the military authorities.</p>

<p>Proud and happy indeed, in his neatly-fitting
uniform, with the corporal’s stripes on
his sleeve and the golden wings and star
insignia on his collar, Don Hale set out on his
journey to join the escadrille, then encamped
not far from Bar-le-Duc, near the Verdun front.</p>

<h1 id='chXI'>CHAPTER XI—THE LAFAYETTE</h1>

<p>Of all the flying corps in France none performed
more valiant deeds or became more renowned
than the Lafayette, composed of
Americans who journeyed across the sea to
help the French in their struggle against the
invading hosts. Whether it was in answer to
the call of adventure due to the love of thrills
and excitement, or to the fascination of a new
and wonderful sport, or simply from a sense
of duty, are questions of no particular moment—the
members of the flying corps are to
be judged solely by the remarkable work they
accomplished.</p>

<p>The fame of such combat pilots as Rockwell,
Prince, Chadwick, MCConnell, Lufbery, Hall,
Walcott and numbers of others is of the kind
which will last as long as history itself. Never
again, perhaps, will men be called upon to repeat
their triumphs.</p>

<p>The day Don Hale arrived was an epochal
one in his life. George Glenn and T. Singleton
Albert met him at the station in a little
village crowded with soldiers and permissionnaires.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you, Don, how glad I am to see
you; and yet I’m almost sorry to see you,” exclaimed
Albert, enigmatically. “You’re in
for excitement that will make your days as
an ambulance driver with the Red Cross seem
tame by comparison.”</p>

<p>“And they were plenty thrilling enough to
suit me,” laughed Don. “What’s the latest
news?”</p>

<p>“That this little village was recently
bombed.”</p>

<p>George Glenn pointed to a sign painted on
the side of a building.</p>

<p>“‘Cave Voûté,’” read Don, aloud.</p>

<p>These caves, he knew, were underground
retreats, where the soldiers or inhabitants could
find a refuge in case of a bombardment or a
bomb-dropping expedition of the enemy.</p>

<p>“One good thing—our camp is outside the
range of the guns,” said George.</p>

<p>As the boys walked through the little
village, which, during the earlier stages of the
war, had been the scene of many an exciting
event, Don Hale could not help but remarking
on the changed appearance of T. Singleton
Albert. There was a gravity and sedateness
about him which he judged to be caused
by the dangers to which the airmen are constantly
exposed.</p>

<p>“Had any exciting adventures yet, Drugstore?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Plenty of them,” responded Albert. And
then a light which Don Hale had never seen
before flashed into the young chap’s eyes.
“Yet, in spite of that, I wouldn’t have missed
this experience for all the world. Flying has
all the joys, the thrills and excitement of
every other sport beaten a thousand miles. I
certainly owe a whole lot of thanks to Lieutenant
William Thaw.”</p>

<p>The three found plenty to talk about,
though they were often obliged to let their
lively tongues slow down on account of the
lines of marching troops and the almost endless
procession of motor trucks passing in both
directions.</p>

<p>In about three-quarters of an hour they
reached their destination—the headquarters
of the famous Lafayette Escadrille, which
happened to be, at this time, in a beautiful
little villa, situated in the midst of spacious
grounds.</p>

<p>A number of the American pilots cordially
greeted him, and Don was very glad to see
among them Victor Gilbert.</p>

<p>After meeting the courteous French captain
of the escadrille the boy was shown to a room
on the second floor, which he was to share with
several others.</p>

<p>Outside of the hazardous nature of their occupation,
the members of the American
Squadron, unlike the “doughboys” and
poilus, lived a life of ease and comfort. They
had orderlies who attended to their needs,
comfortable feather beds to sleep upon, and
their meals, prepared by a French chef, were
eaten in a dining-room which delighted the
eye by its most artistic furnishings and decorations.</p>

<p>It would have been very hard to analyze
Don Hale’s feelings on this particular occasion.
Expectation, eagerness, happiness and
impatience, all seemed to hold sway over his
thoughts, and though the reality was before
him he could scarcely believe that he actually
had become a member of the famous American
Squadron.</p>

<p>After a substantial lunch, still in the company
of George Glenn and Albert, Don journeyed
to the aviation field not very far away.</p>

<p>With the utmost eagerness, he gazed about
him. He saw numerous hangars, rest tents
and various wooden structures. And, besides
these, parked at one side, were ponderous
motor trucks, trailers and several automobiles.</p>

<p>Attached to the great encampment were
mechanicians, chauffeurs, telephone operators,
Red Cross attendants and motor-cyclists—for
the business of flying has its prosaic side as
well as its thrills. Somehow or other it reminded
Don of a country fair on a large scale,
and it would have seemed to him very natural
indeed had his eyes alighted on a barker,
mounted upon a rostrum, exhorting a crowd
of spectators to enter. There was a certain
air of grimness and sternness, however, about
the men whom they encountered that soon removed
this impression. From the east came
the sullen rumble of countless guns.
Sometimes it was low, like the mutterings of distant
thunder; sometimes it swelled into a
volume, as if a storm was about to burst, and
then, like the sighing of the wind, almost
faded away.</p>

<p>A patrol was just about to leave for the
front, and Don watched the Nieuports taxi
across the ground, rise one after another in
the air, and, after gaining a high altitude,
soar in a V-shaped formation toward the battle
front.</p>

<p>The boy thrilled at the sight, and his eyes
followed the fast-flying planes until they were
lost to sight behind a thin veil of whitish
clouds.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’m pretty sure you know just
what kind of work we are doing here,” said
George Glenn, “but, notwithstanding, I am
going to tell you a few things. Our squadron
belongs to what is known as the group de
combat, and it has a definite sector to cover.</p>

<p>“A patrol is always kept over the enemy’s
lines, not only to prevent the German pilots
from entering ours but to make their lives as
full of spice and adventure as we possibly
can.”</p>

<p>“Still, we have a lot to do besides fighting,”
put in Albert. “Sometimes our duty is to
protect the two or three-seater bombardment
planes, the <span class='it'>avions de réglage</span>, or airplanes used
by those who regulate the artillery fire, and
the observation and photographic planes.
The mission of the big ‘birds,’ although they
are armed with two guns, and sometimes
three, is a purely defensive one.”</p>

<p>“Quite often,” chimed in George, “escorting
bombardment and photographic planes,
we travel quite a long distance into ‘Germany,’
as we call the other side of the barbed
wire entanglements.”</p>

<p>“It must be wonderful!” cried Don.</p>

<p>“Some of our experiences are, I can assure
you,” returned George, with a half smile.
“Now, Don, here is something the captain is
going to tell you, and if you value your life
and my piece of mind you will implicitly
obey his instructions.”</p>

<p>“Fire away!” said Don.</p>

<p>“It is to stick by the formation—always!
The Germans have a habit of pouncing down
upon stragglers, and unless the pilot combines
skill, resourcefulness and courage in equal
proportions, or sheer good luck intervenes, it
is apt to be good-night.”</p>

<p>“You can trust me not to get lost,” said
Don, with a serious look in his eyes. “But,
boys, I want to see my plane—I must see my
plane, and, as the captain is right here on the
field, I reckon he’ll show it to me.”</p>

<p>In this view Don was not mistaken; and
presently a mechanic rolled out of one of the
hangars a small machine, slender of fuselage
and beautiful in its proportions. On the
tapering body was painted an Indian’s head
similar to the one on Lieutenant Thaw’s machine.</p>

<p>“As you see, all of the planes are numbered,”
remarked the captain, “and, in addition,
each of the pilots has some special mark
on the fuselage to distinguish his from the
others.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur le Capitaine,” said Don,
with a grin of delight.</p>

<p>“This machine has a motor of two hundred
horse power and can travel at a speed of about
one hundred and forty miles an hour,” continued
the commander. “And at times you
will need it all,” he added, dryly. “When
may you go up? This afternoon. I will detail
Sergeant Reynolds to accompany you in
his plane. The German lines must not be
crossed, under any consideration, for several
days at least.”</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-157.jpg' alt='' id='illus-157'/>
<p class='caption'>“The German lines must not be crossed”</p>
</div>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Don.</p>

<p>This was a great disappointment to the
boy; for he possessed that daring which
youth is prone to indulge—a daring which
may often lead to disaster, and, as often, be a
means to safety.</p>

<p>The captain, after introducing him to the
mechanic who was to look after the Nieuport,
walked away.</p>

<p>The next half hour was one of unalloyed
delight to Don Hale. He spent it in examining
the plane, the various nickel plated instruments
with which the cockpit was furnished
and the Vickers gun, with its belts of
cartridges.</p>

<p>To fire this stationary weapon the pilot
would have no need to remove his hand from
the controls. The instruments consisted of
a compass, an altimetre to register the height,
a speed indicator and several others. Then
there was a map in a roller case.</p>

<p>The top of the plane was camouflaged by
means of spots of a greenish and brownish
color; and besides the concentric circles of
blue, white, brown and red on the wings the
end of the tail had been painted with the tricolor
of France.</p>

<p>Though Don Hale, as a rule, was a pretty
calm lad, he found it hard to conceal his
nervous tension.</p>

<p>His preliminary flight that afternoon, however,
was really nothing more than a repetition
of those he had taken while in the training
schools. A green pilot was not to be fed
to the hungry Boches, and he stood in no
more danger from that source than if he had
been hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>On the following days the sergeant led him
a little further toward the fighting front.
And then, having received all the protection
which wise counsel and advice could afford,
the young airman was pronounced ready to
begin his career as a combat pilot.</p>

<h1 id='chXII'>CHAPTER XII—ABOVE THE CLOUDS</h1>

<p>On a certain morning, just after sunrise,
Don Hale, in his fur-lined combination suit,
leather aviation helmet, and provided with
heavy goggles and gloves, was strapped in his
machine. It was one of a row of six, which,
in almost perfect alignment, were ready to go
aloft.</p>

<p>There was the greatest activity and noise
about the flying field. The air was filled with
the roar, the drone and the hum of many
motors; and in this sea of sound the reverberations
of the distant guns were, for the time
being, completely lost.</p>

<p>Don had received his instructions to fly
at the rear of a formation of six machines, following
one another at a distance of fifty
metres. This <span class='it'>vol de groupe</span> would patrol the
German lines for a period of several hours.</p>

<p>Don Hale found himself murmuring over
and over again: “At last!” And though he
tried his best to still the rapid pulsations of
his heart—to control a hand that had an extraordinary
tendency to tremble, it was without
avail. He was going up to face peril of
the gravest sort.</p>

<p>Was anything going to happen?</p>

<p>Just then he felt almost afraid to think of
what the fates might hold in store for him.</p>

<p>Presently he saw the captain wave his hand
as a signal, and a moment later the leader of
the patrol rose in the air. The others followed.</p>

<p>There was just an instant more of waiting
for Don Hale, and then he, too, was rolling
over the ground.</p>

<p>As readily as a leaf borne aloft by a gust
of wind the Nieuport answered to the controls
and began spiraling upward.</p>

<p>The six machines rose directly over the
field, and at a height of about two thousand
feet the leader headed toward the east, the
others taking up their respective places in the
formation.</p>

<p>Higher and higher the fleet of wonderful
little machines ascended, and Don Hale
glancing over the side of the cockpit, saw a
wonderful panorama of the rapidly-receding
earth, which the early morning sun was tinting
with a soft and poetic glow. The most
delicate tints of brown and green were broken
here and there by darker notes of a purplish
hue, indicating patches of woods. Crisscrossing
the earth in all directions were the
roads—thread-like lines of palish gray, and,
as though some giant hand had scattered them
carelessly about at widely distant points, were
clusters of little glistening dots—villages, or
what remained of villages. Now and again
the boy’s eyes caught sight of pools, mirroring
on their surfaces the delicate tones of the sky
or the clouds above, and presently the river
Meuse came into view—a faint and hazy
line.</p>

<p>His practice in the school at Pau had taught
Don how to preserve his place in the <span class='it'>vol de
groupe</span>, which, when the tremendous speed of
the Nieuport is considered, is far from easy,
and he had never made a better effort than at
the present time. The new member of the
Lafayette Squadron remembered vividly the
stories he had heard concerning the fate of
youthful and venturesome pilots who had disobeyed
the commander’s orders.</p>

<p>Eagerly, he kept his eyes open for enemy
planes. He could not see any, but he did
perceive, far below him, on both sides of the
line, numbers of grotesque-looking observation
balloons, or sausages, as they have been
jocularly christened.</p>

<p>Now the altimetre registered a height of
over ten thousand feet—they were approaching
the battle-front. Don Hale was about to
get his first view of “Germany.”</p>

<p>The boy, however, was too excited—too absorbed
in the contemplation of the singular
scene below him, and, at the same time, so
occupied in handling his plane that he did
not feel any tingling sensation of fear.</p>

<p>The battle-ground was covered with a thin
veil of purplish smoke, and where the delicate
shadows lay thickest on the earth he could
occasionally distinguish the flashing lights of
the guns or of exploding shells. But it all
seemed very distant—very remote. The
clouds of smoke from the bursting projectiles
and innumerable batteries were but tiny spots
amid the surrounding haze. Don realized
that a vigorous bombardment from both sides
was going on and that a devastating hail of
missiles was creating havoc and destruction in
the opposing trenches and far to their rear.
Then he had a swift glimpse of that irregular
brownish stretch of land running between the
hostile forces—“No Man’s Land,” the most
sinister, the most barren, the most mutilated
strip of earth that has ever existed since the
world began.</p>

<p>The patrol leader was now mounting higher,
and the reason became almost instantly apparent.
The air straight ahead had become
filled with round puffs of viciously-spurting
black smoke. The “Archies” were according
the early morning visitors their usual
warm reception.</p>

<p>A second more, and not so many yards
away there suddenly appeared the largest and
wickedest-looking puff of all, and, above the
roar of the motor, the startled Don Hale could
hear the explosion of the shrapnel shell
launched by the German gunners.</p>

<p>The next instant he felt a terrifying thrill.
His airplane was falling through space.</p>

<p>Almost stifled by the air rushing past, with
a horrifying vision of impending catastrophe,
the boy, nevertheless, managed to keep his
wits about him. But escape seemed impossible.
A perfect hail of “Archies” popped
up in the air to the rear, to the side and to
the front of the falling machine, the control
of which he was desperately trying to
regain.</p>

<p>Though his agony of suspense seemed long
drawn out it was but a moment when the
terrifying descent was over and the machine
again flying parallel to the earth.</p>

<p>It was almost miraculous that it had not
been riddled with the fragments of the bursting
shrapnel shells. The din of their almost
continuous explosions was ringing in the
aviator’s ears, and in the violently-disturbed
air the Nieuport was rocking and plunging
like a boat in a heavy sea.</p>

<p>“Never fly in a straight line” was the advice
which had been given to Don before setting
out on the expedition, and after the first
few moments of suspense had passed Don
Hale managed to sufficiently calm his jumping
nerves and follow this instruction. He
turned the nose of his machine upward, and,
in a zigzagging flight, shot like a rocket into
the blue depths above.</p>

<p>A little later he found an infinite relief in
seeing the black thunderbolts exploding hundreds
of yards below.</p>

<p>But where was the rest of the patrol? They
seemed to have utterly vanished. A strange
sense of loneliness such as he had never known
before took possession of him. And then,
like a flash, he recalled George Glenn’s words:
“The Germans have a habit of pouncing down
upon any stragglers they may happen to see.”</p>

<p>Were there any enemy scouts about?</p>

<p>He cast a swift, comprehensive glance over
the vast expanse of sky.</p>

<p>A number of planes were to be seen far to
the rear of the German lines, but whether
friends or enemies the new combat pilot could
not possibly determine. At any rate, he was
sure his companions must have ascended to
the cloud level, now close overhead.</p>

<p>Still thrilled at the thought of his narrow
escape, he sent the biplane climbing higher
aloft. Nothing in his school days could be
compared to this flight, a flight in which
danger threatened every moment</p>

<p>Plunging into a cloud, the machine became
enveloped in soft and fleecy masses of vapor.
Not a thing could Don see in any direction.
It was a most weird and curious sensation,
he found, to be sailing so far above the
earth, in the midst of the fog; and though
he experienced a certain sense of freedom
from danger he had an unpleasant feeling
of half suffocation, which impelled him to
escape as soon as possible from their enfolding
embrace.</p>

<p>Now, through a jagged opening he caught a
glimpse of the earth, and just a moment afterward
something happened which gave him
the greatest scare he had yet had in his brief
flying career.</p>

<p>A shadowy object—so faint as to be scarcely
discernible—flashed into view to his right, and,
while he gazed toward it as though fascinated,
in a second of time it had grown into an object
of seemingly gigantic proportions, though
still so faint in outline that he could scarcely
take in its exact form.</p>

<p>Another instant and the phantom-like plane
had swept past with lightning speed, leaving
in its wake powerful currents o
wildly swirling vapor, while the airplane, caught in
the eddy, staggered and shook.</p>

<p>“Whew! That was another close call!”
breathed Don. “Sure enough!—this isn’t
a game for weak nerves. Hello—goodness
gracious!”</p>

<p>The Nieuport had shot above the strata of
clouds.</p>

<p>Even though his nerves were still tingling,
his pulse throbbing violently, the combat
pilot could not repress a gasp of admiration
as he gazed out over the immense expanse of
billowy forms that stretched in every direction
in a vast circle against the soft blue field of
sky.</p>

<p>It was still early, the sun had not risen
high, and its rays, falling upon the clouds,
tinted them with the most delicate of rosy
hues.</p>

<p>“I almost seem out of the world,” murmured
Don, a trifle awesomely.</p>

<p>“And how perfectly safe it looks I—just as
though one could float about on the clouds
and be in no danger of taking a header to the
earth. But where am I in this curious world
above? And, more important than all, where
are the other planes? I’d be in a nice position,
shouldn’t I, if some of Captain Richtofen’s
Red Squadron should happen to come
along! What shall I do?”</p>

<p>The boy found that skimming close to the
fleecy, ever-changing billows, sometimes dipping
into them, was a fascinating sport. Up
there everything was peace, loneliness and
quietude. It seemed almost incredible that
only a few miles below, on the earth he had
just left, a terrible war was being waged and
that every moment tragedies and horrors were
taking place.</p>

<p>But the time for decisive action had
come.</p>

<p>Boldly, though not without some trepidation,
he plunged back into the clouds. Then
came a brief period of dense obscurity, followed
by a weird, spectral illumination, as
the daylight struggled to pierce the masses of
moisture-laden air; and presently the Nieuport
was again in full view of the shell-torn,
battle-scarred earth, far over a hostile country.</p>

<p>Many planes could now be seen, some below,
some faint and hazy in the distance,
others comparatively near</p>

<p>And while Don was scanning each in turn,
hoping to recognize the familiar Indian’s head
on the fuselage, he suddenly became conscious
of the fact that not very far away a fight in
the air had begun. Probably half a dozen or
more combat pilots were engaged; and, almost
forgetting, in his interest and excitement,
the danger of his position, Don Hale
watched the wonderful spectacle, with his
nerves at the keenest tension.</p>

<p>Every acrobatic performance which he himself
had learned at the advanced school at
Pau was being used by the rival airmen.</p>

<p>Now and again one or another went down
in a spinning nose dive, as though the machine
were totally out of control; but instead
of crashing to the earth it would right
itself, and, with almost incredible speed, rise
again to the attack. Fairly leaping over one
another, flashing this way and that, narrowly
avoiding collisions, they soared upward or
swooped down, as a flock of enraged birds
fighting among themselves might have done,
and, faintly, the enthralled Don Hale could
hear the vicious crackling of the machine
guns, steadily spurting forth their messenger
of death, and see the faint smoking lines left
by the tracer ballets.</p>

<p>Were any members of the Lafayette Squadron
engaged in the conflict?</p>

<p>The boy mentally voiced this query over
and over again as he flew around in a sweeping
circle, keeping far above the contenders.</p>

<p>He felt an almost irresistible impulse to
join in the fray, and but for the fact that the
squadron commander had explicitly ordered
him to act only on the defensive probably
would have done so. He had seen many a
fight from the ground, but then the thrills
were of a decidedly different nature from those
which came while he was in the pilot’s seat
of an airplane.</p>

<p>A moment more, and, just as suddenly as
the battle had begun, it ended. One of the
combat planes began to fall, turning over and
over in the air, now and then the dull gray
wings with the Maltese crosses clearly outlined
against the floating masses of smoke below.</p>

<p>Into these it plunged and disappeared from
view.</p>

<p>Thankful that neither his compatriots no
any of the Allied airmen had been the victim,
yet shuddering at the thought of the human
life which had been sacrificed to the greed of
the God of War, Don Hale headed for the
west, having satisfied himself that the Allied
planes, now rapidly retreating, belonged to a
French air squadron.</p>

<p>The black, sputtering “Archies” were beginning
to burst beneath him again, one coming
so dangerously near that once more a sort
of consternation gripped him.</p>

<p>“This won’t do at all!” he muttered. “A
little bit nearer the ceiling for me!”</p>

<p>He was approaching the lines and “No
Man’s Land” and following its tortuous
course with his eyes he observed in many
places the sudden bursts of smoke which told
of the explosions of high-calibre shells. All
about him the atmosphere was hazy and the
distance entirely obscured.</p>

<p>Now rapidly becoming familiar with the
new game, Don began to feel more like himself.
For the first time he could understand
how it was that the experienced pilots learned
to treat with comparative indifference the
angry shrieks of the attacking “Archies.”</p>

<p>At length Don Hale discovered the patrol
of Lafayette machines flying in a perfect
formation just over the enemy’s line.</p>

<p>After facing the dangers of the sky alone
the sense of relief and pleasure that the
sight of friends near at hand afforded him
was delightful indeed. He felt like uttering
a whoop of joy.</p>

<p>“Considering all such experiences as I’ve
just had once is too much!” he muttered to
himself. “And this time you can just bet I’ll
not get separated.”</p>

<p>Nor did he. The patrol, which was only
policing the air, led him into no further
danger, and, consequently, when the two
hours was over and they headed for the
aviation field, nothing had occurred to add
more thrills to those he had already received.</p>

<p>Don Hale, however, was thoroughly glad to
see the great encampment coming into view;
and equally glad when he had spiraled down
to the earth and made an almost perfect
<span class='it'>atterrissage</span>.</p>

<p>Waiting machinists helped him out of the
cockpit; and as he answered the questions
fired toward him the boy felt as proud and
happy as any of the “aces” whose fame has
spread throughout the world.</p>

<p>His first reconnaissance over the enemy’s
line was something he could never forget</p>

<h1 id='chXIII'>CHAPTER XIII—THE FARMER</h1>

<p>Several weeks passed, during which Don
Hale became thoroughly familiar with and
accustomed to the work of the escadrille.
The boy was surprised to find how soon the
unpleasant feelings which had assailed him
on his first day’s sortie over the lines had
worn off. True, he did pass through some
harrowing moments—terrible moments, in
which it seemed as though he was doomed to
destruction. But, in general, familiarity with
the dangers brought that indifference which a
seasoned veteran in any of life’s great games
usually acquires.</p>

<p>By this time the young aviator had engaged
in practically every kind of work done by the
squadron. He, in company with other pilots,
had acted as escorts to the big Caudron bombarding
machines, the artillery regulating
planes, and those whose duty it was to travel
over the enemy’s country, observing and taking
photographs.</p>

<p>During several of these trips he had been
introduced to what the boys pleasantly termed
“flaming onions.” These are balls of fire sent
in a stream from a special gun, and they
travel with tremendous speed. Fortunately,
however, these sportive attempts of the Germans
did no damage to either him or his
machine.</p>

<p>During a vigorous attack when the French
had succeeded in capturing and holding several
of the German trenches he learned a great
deal about contact patrol. This consisted of
working in conjunction with the infantry,
keeping them informed of everything that
was taking place on the other side of “No
Man’s Land,” guarding them in every way
from surprises and doing all that was possible
to facilitate their “Going over the top” by
flying low over the ground and vigorously
attacking the enemy’s troops.</p>

<p>Contact patrol was the most dangerous work
of all; for the pilots ran not only the risk of
being struck down by the shells from the east
but also by those sent by their own batteries
in the rear.</p>

<p>Occasionally, too, he joined expeditions
which set out to destroy the big observation
balloons which hung constantly in the sky,
and on one of these trips he had seen an unwieldy
monster, somewhat suggestive of an
elephant with its trunk cut off, sent flaming
to the ground.</p>

<p>But there was a sad, a tragic side connected
with all the splendid and courageous work
accomplished by the combat pilots. There
were some who never returned, and who were
listed in the official “<span class='it'>communique</span>”<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a> as being
among the missing. There were others, too,
whose planes, riddled by the enemy’s bullets,
were sent crashing earthward, to be smashed
and splintered and torn apart by the terrific
impact.</p>

<p>Those were days of gloom and sorrow; but
the inevitable had to be accepted.</p>

<p>Two events which interested Don Hale
and T. Singleton Albert were the arrivals,
at different times, of Bobby Dunlap and
Jason Hamlin. The meeting between the
latter and Victor Gilbert was of a nature
no more cordial than that at the training
school.</p>

<p>Gilbert glared at the other, demanding
gruffly:</p>

<p>“You seem to find it hard to keep away
from my company. There are other Franco-American
Squadrons.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your charming and subtle
intimation,” rejoined Hamlin, dryly. “Let
me say, however, that I pulled every wire I
could so that I might have the pleasure of
joining this squadron.”</p>

<p>“Frightfully agreeable, I’m sure!” muttered
Gilbert, turning away.</p>

<p>“I say, Peur Jamais,” exclaimed Don Hale,
some time later, “how is the Sherlock Holmes
business getting on?”</p>

<p>Bobby wagged his head mysteriously.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m on the trail of something, and
maybe I’m not,” he responded. “What do
I think it is? To quote a classical remark:
‘I have nothing to say at this time.’ Bombs
aren’t the only things that make explosions.
Now let us drop the mystery.”</p>

<p>“That’s better than dropping a bomb,”
laughed Don.</p>

<p>“That depends upon where you drop it,”
chirped Bobby. “But, believe me, Donny,
that Hamlin person is some flyer. He’d make
an eagle so ashamed of himself that he’d
swear off flying and stay on the ground forever.
I believe he could almost fly by waving
his arms in the air.”</p>

<p>“Wish I could!” sighed Don. “It would
come in mighty handy if a fellow’s plane
were shot away from him while he was five
miles in the air.”</p>

<p>Often pilots when off duty gathered in the
bureau, or office, where reports were turned in
and other necessary routine work of the
squadron transacted. Hanging on the wall
was a very large map of the sector, amazingly
complete, showing the location of German
aviation centres and even the points where
their observation balloons were anchored.
Naturally, from time to time, there were
changes in the map, and the members of the
squadron often found great interest in studying
it and speculating as to its appearance a
few months hence.</p>

<p>As days succeeded days Don, George Glenn,
T. Singleton Albert and Bobby Dunlap frequently
met in the bureau, and it was on one
of these occasions that Bobby took Don Hale
aside, and, in a very impressive manner, remarked:</p>

<p>“Do you remember those nights at the Café
Rochambeau when old Père Goubain told us
a whole lot about German spies?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Don.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t think he was so very far
wrong. I’m brighter than the next person,
and it looks to me as if the trail were getting
warm.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Don spoke in a mystified tone.</p>

<p>“Spies—spies!” chuckled Bobby.</p>

<p>“But where are they? Maybe you think
I’m a spy?”</p>

<p>“If you are you’d better be careful of little
Sherlock,” chirped Peur Jamais.</p>

<p>Some time later, the pilots were rather surprised
and amused to see an old French peasant
standing out front and gazing in evident
wonder at the aviation fields. He was a
typical son of the soil, wearing wooden sabots,
or shoes; and his faded blue garments showed
many traces of his labor in the fields. Almost
primitive in appearance, and suggesting
the uncouth, illiterate peasants which the
French painter Millet loved to depict, he
seemed so out of place amidst that most
modern of all scenes—an aviation centre—that
many of the boys found it rather hard to
stifle an inclination to laugh.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s the news from your section
of the universe?” asked Bobby Dunlap, waggishly.</p>

<p>The peasant glanced at him rather stupidly
for a moment and then drawled:</p>

<p>“There aren’t enough people left in the
place where I come from to be any news.
There’s an awful big war going on, isn’t
there?”</p>

<p>“Goodness! So you’ve discovered it, too!”
laughed Bobby. “Where do you live?”</p>

<p>“Not so very far away.”</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of changing your vocation
and becoming an aviator?”</p>

<p>The stolid-looking peasant, evidently seeing
no humor in the remark, shook his head and
mumbled:</p>

<p>“No.” Then, in a half-embarrassed manner,
he inquired: “May I take a glance inside
the house?”</p>

<p>“To be sure!” exclaimed Jason Hamlin.</p>

<p>“The world owes everything to the farmer.
He is the foundation upon which the world
leans. Without him——”</p>

<p>“We’d have to become farmers ourselves,”
giggled Bobby.</p>

<p>The peasant, evidently feeling awed by his
surroundings, entered the bureau.</p>

<p>Once inside he gazed about him with a sort
of abstracted air, uttered a few observations
which caused titters of laughter to run around
the room, and, presently, remarked to Jason
Hamlin:</p>

<p>“This war hasn’t done any good to farming.
Pretty big map on the wall. What’s it there
for?”</p>

<p>Repressing a smile, T. Singleton Albert attempted
to explain, in his own peculiar style
of French, whereupon the visiting farmer exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Too bad! But I don’t speak any language
except that of my own country.”</p>

<p>A loud laugh went up at the expense of the
furiously-blushing Drugstore.</p>

<p>And then Don took it upon himself to impart
the information.</p>

<p>“I see!” exclaimed the peasant, musingly.</p>

<p>He walked over to the map and began to
examine it, his expression, however, indicating
an utter lack of comprehension.</p>

<p>Victor Gilbert, who happened to be among
the crowd, remarked in English:</p>

<p>“It’s too bad that the laboring classes
should be so uneducated. And the lack of
training dwarfs what intelligence they have,
so that their minds fail to grasp even simple
things.”</p>

<p>The others agreed with him.</p>

<p>But, at any rate, they found the visit of the
farmer a pleasant diversion, and all were
really sorry when he said good-bye and
started for the door.</p>

<p>“That old chap is about the limit,” growled
T. Singleton Albert. “Talk about ignorance!
It’s a positive wonder he has enough sense to
find his way home.”</p>

<p>“And just think!—the poor fellow understands
only French,” chirped Bobby Dunlap.</p>

<p>Drugstore was about to retort, when the
entrance of several pilots stopped him.</p>

<p>The newcomers had something to tell, too,
which aroused a great deal of interest—several
of them had had thrilling encounters with
Captain Baron Von Richtofen’s Red Squadron
of Death.</p>

<p>“I feel sure the Baron was there himself,”
declared one. “The way those planes were
handled was simply marvelous. I thought I
had certainly winged a Boche when he went
into the vrille; and I swooped down after him
for about two thousand feet, intending to
make sure of it. But, in some extraordinary
manner, he got his plane under control, and
before I could realize it I was shooting below
him and his bullets were humming a tune
past my ears.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, that is music I don’t like to
hear!” said Bobby, with a perceptible shiver.</p>

<p>“I reckon all of us prefer symphonies of a
less dangerous kind,” remarked Gilbert, adding,
rather reflectively: “I haven’t had the
pleasure yet of meeting that Baron and his
pirate crew. Perhaps some day I shall.”</p>

<p>“Then let us hope it will be a red letter
day for you,” cried Don.</p>

<p>That night the escadrille was once more
saddened by the disappearance of one of its
members, and all telephone queries to the observation
posts failed to reveal what had
come of him. It was feared, however, that
he had fallen behind the German lines and
been either killed or captured by the enemy.</p>

<p>Many of the pilots remained late in the bureau
discussing their fellow aviator’s possible
fate, and while they were busily talking the
sound of an anti-aircraft gun brought all who
were sitting to their feet.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that means a Boche bombing
raid!” cried Don Hale, excitedly.</p>

<p>The next instant a frightful din of crashing
guns rent the air.</p>

<p>With a common impulse, a rush was made
for the door.</p>

<h1 id='chXIV'>CHAPTER XIV—THE BOMBARDMENT</h1>

<p>By the time the excited crowd had piled
outside powerful search-lights were reaching
up into the starlit heavens, lifting out of the
gloom with strange and fantastic effect the
thin veil of clouds which here and there
stretched across it.</p>

<p>Even amid the booming of the anti-aircraft
batteries and the sharper staccato reports
of the machine guns from various parts of the
field, all blending into an unearthly din, the
droning of the motors high in the air could
be distinctly heard. Like a pyrotechnic display,
luminous bullets, searching for the invaders,
shot up into the sky, often piercing
the low-hanging clouds; and mingling in
with them were vicious little spurts of fire
which told of the explosion of shrapnel
shells.</p>

<p>The majority of the pilots, familiar with
the dreadful danger which menaced them,
made a wild dash for the underground
shelters. But Don Hale and a few others,
fascinated by the awe-inspiring scene and
situation, remained.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this awful!” cried Bobby Dunlap,
with a distinct tremolo in his voice. “Great
Scott!”</p>

<p>At that instant a loud, though dull boom
from the explosion of a bomb had added its
quota of noise to the raging inferno of sound.</p>

<p>It hadn’t landed so far away, either, and,
as Don Hale, in the grip of fear and excitement
which he found impossible to control,
strove to pierce the gloom, three reports, even
louder, followed one another in quick succession.</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar!” cried Bobby Dunlap. “It
seems as though they are going to wipe the
aviation camp off the map. It’s time for us
to run for our lives.”</p>

<p>And with these words, jerked out so fast
that they were scarcely intelligible, he started
off on a headlong sprint to join those who had
sought a haven of safety.</p>

<p>But even then neither Don, George nor
Albert could tear themselves away from the
singular scene that was passing before their
eyes. Every search-light—every gun was being
used. Dazzling streams of whitish light
crossed and criss-crossed or swept in wide
circles over the sky—the darkness of night
seemed to be rent asunder. Flaming bullets
were rising by the thousand.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the terrific defense of the
French batteries the German bombs continued
to fall. Their appalling detonations seemed
fairly to shake the ground.</p>

<p>It was a situation wherein the tragic and
the terrible held full sway. No man alive
could have stood it without fear and trembling;
for, at any instant, one of the bombs
might have fallen into their very midst.</p>

<p>And then, while they stood there, motionless,
silent, their pulses quickened by the
emotions within, they saw something which
brought husky exclamations from their lips.</p>

<p>It was the sight of a German plane, spectral
and ghostlike, sailing serenely along in a
dazzling sea of light. Flying this way and
that, it now and then almost disappeared in
the obscurity beyond, but, inexorably, it was
pulled back into the field of vision by the
ever-moving rays. And then a second and a
third plane sprang into view, all appearing as
pale, ethereal and ghostlike as the other.</p>

<p>And as the pilots kept their eyes fixed upon
this wonderful and singular spectacle, which
seemed to combine the elements of the supernatural
and unreal, they became witnesses to
a scene which is given to but few in this world
to see.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just beneath the foremost machine,
now in the full glare of light, there appeared
a tiny flash of fire, a tiny burst of
smoke—the circling flight was ended. Almost
simultaneously with the explosion of
the shrapnel shell the battleplane began to
fall, at first slowly, as though the airmen near
the clouds were desperately seeking to regain
control.</p>

<p>What was going to happen? A few seconds
would tell.</p>

<p>They were thrilling seconds, too, to the
little shivering knot of spectators by the
bureau.</p>

<p>“Ah—ah!”</p>

<p>A long-drawn, shrill exclamation came
from Don Hale.</p>

<p>The plane, after wobbling and staggering
for the briefest instant, began a spinning dive
toward the earth; and before it had gone
many hundred feet a portion of one of its
wings was seen to become detached. Almost
instantly came a little burst of ruddy flame,
rapidly increasing in intensity, until, at last,
the airplane was blazing from end to end.
Like a flaming meteorite, the doomed machine,
still bathed in the dazzling white glare,
continued its frightful plunge.</p>

<p>Down, down, it came, whirling and spinning,
growing larger and more distinct with
each passing second, and leaving behind it a
long sinuous trail of sparks and inky smoke.</p>

<p>Absorbed—enthralled by the terrible spectacle,
Don Hale almost forgot the danger that
ever menaced them.</p>

<p>But before the plane had reached the
ground the peril of their exposed position was
brought forcibly to his mind by another loud
report from a bursting bomb. It seemed to
have fallen nearer at hand than any of the
others; and he was just about to urge his
companions to leave when, without warning,
there came a frightful and appalling explosion,
so terrible in its power that he found himself
jerked off his feet and thrown violently forward.</p>

<p>Shocked, dazed and bewildered, he struck
the turf at full length, where he lay as
motionless as if the end had come.</p>

<p>He was brought to his senses, however, as
suddenly as though ice-water had been dashed
into his face. The explosion had hurled aloft
great masses of earth and debris; and now,
like a descending avalanche, they began beating
upon the ground close about him with
thuds and bangs and crashes.</p>

<p>With a startled cry, the boy staggered up.
A clump of earth struck him on the back
with almost stunning force; a piece of board
crashed down at his feet, and in wild haste,
he began the retreat that should have been
made before.</p>

<p>And, to add to the danger, spent bullets
from the shrapnel shells came pelting down.</p>

<p>The distance to the nearest underground
shelter was very short, but it seemed like a
mighty long way to the frightened runners.
Could they reach it?</p>

<p>Panting, perspiring, almost desperate, they
crossed the last lap of the intervening space
and fairly threw themselves into the crowded
bomb-proof shelter.</p>

<p>Their wild and unceremonious entrance
brought exclamations from the crowd. But
no effort was made to speak, however, for,
amid the mighty, crashing chorus of the
guns, voices could scarcely have been heard.</p>

<p>Huddled together in the shelter, which was
dimly lighted by a single oil lamp, feeling
the earth trembling beneath their feet, the
pilots listened with awe to the sound of the
explosions. It was mighty unpleasant to be
cooped up—mighty unpleasant to think of
what might be happening to the hangars and
the little fighting Nieuports, and when, after
what seemed to be an interminably long time,
the din of the anti-aircraft guns and bursting
bombs began to slacken, Don Hale gave a big
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s all over, boys,” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make the Germans sorry for
this,” cried Bobby Dunlap.</p>

<p>As the crowd, headed by Don, made for the
door the firing had ceased, and, in contrast to
the terrific racket of a few moments before,
the comparative silence seemed almost strange
and unnatural. The giant search-lights were
still sweeping the sky, but the enemy had
evidently been driven away.</p>

<p>Intent upon finding out as quickly as possible
what damage had been done, Don Hale
and George Glenn hurried toward the point
where the bombs seemed to have fallen most
thickly. Men were hurrying this way and
that, and officers could be heard shouting
their orders. It quickly developed, however,
that the camp, very fortunately, had sustained
but little damage. Great pits had
been dug in the ground by the force of the
explosions, the end of a hangar demolished,
and two machines and a little storehouse
destroyed.</p>

<p>“Now I feel very much better,” declared
Don. “Honestly, I never expected to see that
Nieuport of mine again.”</p>

<p>“From the amount of noise they made, one
might have thought the whole camp was going
skyward,” declared George. “Before the
Boches have a chance to pay us another visit,
Don, let’s beat it for the villa.”</p>

<p>“Done as soon as said,” exclaimed Don.</p>

<p>Long accustomed to the terrors and scares
of the war zone, the boys had now entirely
recovered from the effects of the bombardment
from the sky.</p>

<p>With a number of others, they climbed into
a big camion and were driven to their headquarters.
On the way they saw encampments
of soldiers in the fields, their tents, with lights
inside, showing as faintly luminous spots in
the darkness. Now and again a long convoy
lumbered along the road; batteries were moving
up nearer the front; reserves, too, passed
them, marching steadily and silently, the
rhythmic sound of their steadily-tramping feet
sounding weirdly in the night.</p>

<p>And though no particular incident marked
the journey, Don and George were thoroughly
glad when they reached their comfortable
room in the ancient villa.</p>

<p>Tired, after the many hours of work and
excitement, they immediately turned in.</p>

<p>And thus ended another day.</p>

<h1 id='chXV'>CHAPTER XV—A BATTLE IN THE CLOUDS</h1>

<p>During the following afternoon Don Hale
and T. Singleton Albert were detailed, with
eight other pilots, to act as an escort to a big
Caudron photographic machine, which was to
make a trip to a point many miles inside the
German lines in order to take photographs of
a railroad centre.</p>

<p>Don Hale’s machine on this occasion was
armed with eight rockets, with dart-like heads,
four on either side of the fuselage. These are
designed for the purpose of destroying observation
balloons, bullets from the machine guns
not being sufficiently large for the purpose.
The rockets are projected into space at terrific
speed by means of powerful spiral springs, and
ignite at the instant of departure.</p>

<p>The art of photography has been a great
factor in the world war, driving secrecy from
its cover and enabling the opposing forces to
make an almost complete record of what was
taking place on the other side of the line.</p>

<p>The two-seater Caudron machine which the
combat pilots were designated to protect was
armed with only one swivel gun. The cameras,
pointing downward, were attached to the
sides of the fuselage, and in order to take a
photograph it was necessary only to pull a
string.</p>

<p>It was rather late when the commanding
officer gave the signal for the departure. In a
spiraling flight, the Nieuports rose in the air,
and, at an altitude of about six thousand feet,
waited for the photographic machine to meet
them at their airy rendezvous.</p>

<p>Immediately arranging themselves in a V-shaped
formation, with the big Caudron at the
apex, the fleet of planes headed for “Germany.”
Very soon some of the fighting
Nieuports dropped below the machine they
were escorting, while others soared a thousand
feet above.</p>

<p>The weather was hot and sultry, and frequently
the swiftly-speeding planes cut
through patches of lazily-floating clouds,
which left shining drops of moisture clinging
to spars and struts. They sailed high above
a long line of French observation balloons,
and could see others belonging to the enemy—faint
yellowish dots in the distance. But
Don Hale was paying very little attention to
them, for the famous town of Verdun, responsible
for some of the most desperate battles
ever fought in the history of the world,
appeared before his eyes. Here and there
were great gaps among the red-roofed houses,
showing where the high-explosive shells of the
Germans had shattered and torn and blown
everything to pieces. Faintly, he could see
those mighty forts—Vaux and Douaumont
and, in another direction, the famous Mort-Homme,
so valiantly defended by the French.</p>

<p>And the same scenes which he had witnessed
on all his trips over the front were
again before him—the haze of smoke floating
high above the battle-field, the batteries in
action, the flashes of the exploding shells, and
the airplanes either hovering like flocks of
birds or patrolling the lines.</p>

<p>As they passed over the trenches the Caudron
and its escorting Nieuports rose to an
altitude of fifteen thousand feet; for the air
beneath them was filled with the little balls
of black smoke which told that the “Archies”
would have liked nothing better than to bring
them crashing to the earth. The pigmy and
futile efforts of the gunners, however, only
served to amuse Don Hale. How harmless
the exploding shells appeared! Yet how terrible
they were when viewed at closer range!</p>

<p>At various points, silhouetted against the
blue of the sky or the scintillating white of
the clouds, he could make out hostile airplanes
which, as was often the case, were keeping
well to the rear of their own lines.</p>

<p>Would they be attacked?</p>

<p>Don Hale scarcely thought so, or, at least,
not so long as the formation kept together.</p>

<p>Thus, with his mind at comparative ease,
he thoroughly enjoyed the swift flight through
the cool air high above the earth. Gazing
over the side of the little cockpit, he studied
the territory occupied by the Germans with
an interest which familiarity never seemed to
lessen. Occasionally Don’s view of the network
of roads, the tiny villages and the farms,
surrounded by their vari-colored fields, was
blotted from view by the constantly
increasing layers of fleecy white clouds. Their
shadows were chasing each other over the
warmly-tinted earth.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing straight into “Germany,”
and, to Don Hale, the weather conditions
seemed to be fast becoming ominous and
threatening. This thought at length became
a little disquieting. If anything should happen
to their planes while over the enemy’s
country it might mean a descent; and a descent
would undoubtedly mean capture—an
inglorious end to a flying career—a fate particularly
dreaded by the airmen.</p>

<p>“I won’t be sorry when this trip is over,”
muttered Don to himself. “This kind of
life certainly gives a chap fifty-seven different
kinds of feelings.”</p>

<p>Owing to the great velocity of the flying
flotilla, their destination, a town of considerable
size, soon afterward came into view, and
the whole formation volplaned to a lower
level. Now they plunged through the clouds.
And on emerging Don could see many evidences
of life and activity going on below.
Here and there were aviation fields bordered
by gray hangars. Almost directly beneath a
column of troops on the march suggested so
many tiny ants creeping slowly over the
ground. A long line of moving dots on a
white road indicated a convoy going up
nearer the line, while on a railroad leading
into the town the eager and interested young
combat pilot espied a train traveling, apparently,
with a strange and sloth-like motion.</p>

<p>And now the peaceful character of the voyage
came to an end. The “Archies” were at
work again, and on every side, and dangerously
near. Don Hale saw the wicked, lashing
little balls of black smoke, though the explosions
of the shells could scarcely be heard.
Nor were the flying men threatened by the anti-aircraft
batteries alone: Albatross and Fokker
machines were approaching. And, in order
that the enemy planes might not gain too
great an altitude and be in a position to dive
down upon them, the leader of the flotilla
gave a prearranged signal; whereupon several
of the convoys began following him to a
higher level.</p>

<p>Don Hale, however, had been instructed to
remain below, while the photographs were being
taken, and the prospect was not altogether
a pleasant one. He well knew that the Caudron
would take all sorts of risks in order to
obtain the desired pictures; and the protecting
Nieuports, to fulfil the duties imposed
upon them, must all expect to run a fiery
gauntlet of shrapnel.</p>

<p>Down—still further down, as though unmindful
of their spiteful presence, the big
Caudron flew in a circling flight directly over
the town.</p>

<p>Now in light, now in shadow, the collection
of buildings made a pleasant picture.
The golden cross surmounting the spire of the
lone church occasionally reflected the mellow
rays of the sun, and, like a jet of fire, sent its
light into the sky.</p>

<p>But these were things to which Don Hale
paid not the slightest attention: his mind
was wholly wrapped up in the work ahead of
him. He was playing a game in which life
and liberty were at stake, and, as the Nieuport
rocked and shook in the currents of the
air disturbed by the almost continual explosions
of the shrapnel shells, he warily watched
the movements of the enemy planes.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, now that the perilous
moment had come, he felt neither excited,
apprehensive nor alarmed. An almost unnatural
calmness seemed to have a hold upon
him; and even when he saw a hole suddenly
appear on the left-hand side of the upper plane,
which meant that a piece of flying lead had
pierced it, he did not lose his steadiness of
hand or presence of mind.</p>

<p>He seemed to be fairly surrounded by the
bursting shells. In every direction he turned
they were there to meet him. The “flaming
onions,” too, were beginning to cut their fiery
passage through the air; and as they traveled
with terrible swiftness the danger from them
was even greater than that from the anti-aircraft
guns.</p>

<p>Around and around soared the photographic
machine; and around and around soared the
Nieuports, both above and below. It was a
veritable ride of death, with a chance that
some of the combat pilots would pay the penalty
for their daring, and be recorded in the
brief official communique as among the missing
or the dead.</p>

<p>Suddenly the photographic machine darted
downward. Don Hale, with his eyes fixed
upon it, almost held his breath with suspense
and apprehension. It seemed scarcely possible
that the pilot could rise again.</p>

<p>However, just as this gloomy thought was
becoming fixed in his mind, the airplane began
to ascend.</p>

<p>Intuitively, the boy realized that the dangerous
mission of the photographer and his pilot
was over; for, like a captive bird escaping
from its imprisoning cage, the Caudron shot
steadily upward, and was soon far beyond the
reach of the guns below.</p>

<p>The lower escorting planes, which many
times had come close to destruction, immediately
followed.</p>

<p>And then Don Hale, strange to say, began
to feel the effects of a reaction. The hand, so
steady in the midst of terrible peril, now
trembled slightly. He found it hard to shake
off a curious foreboding—a foreboding that
sometimes sent chills along his spine—that
much might happen in that perilous return
journey over a hostile land.</p>

<p>To show that his fears were entirely justified,
when once again the boy gazed aloft he
discovered that some of the bolder enemy
scouts, now assembled in a formation as formidable
as their own, were hot on the trail of
the fast retreating Americans.</p>

<p>“Looks like a scrap,” murmured Don.</p>

<p>The pilot cast a look at his machine gun
and belt of cartridges, all ready on the instant.</p>

<p>Should he have to use them? He hoped
not; yet it looked that way.</p>

<p>And all the time the wind was steadily increasing
in force, making necessary the closest
attention and most extreme care in handling
the biplane. Thus, with the elements against
him and surrounded by the gravest danger,
Don Hale decided that by the time he reached
the aviation field, if he ever did, he should be
able to recount a tale as interesting as any of
those he had often heard.</p>

<p>Occasionally he glanced over the side of
the fuselage, to see the big Caudron, now considerably
below him, sometimes skimming
close above the clouds and sometimes enveloped
in masses of vapor. He very well
knew that if an attack were made the photographic
machine would be the principal object
sought for, owing to the value of the
records it was carrying.</p>

<p>And while Don was busily reflecting upon
this he suddenly realized that action both
above and below him had begun. He could
see several planes whirling and darting about,
and though the rapid reports of the machine
guns were unheard amid the roar of
his motor he caught sight of narrow lines of
smoke left by the passing tracer bullets.</p>

<p>“Great Julius Cæsar!” he muttered. “I
am in for it. I wonder when my part in the
show begins!”</p>

<p>It came much sooner than he had expected.
While several of the Lafayette machines below
and to the rear of the Caudron were engaged
in deadly combat by the enemy a
fighting plane with the ominous Maltese
crosses on its wing flashed past Don Hale,
diving vertically toward the tail of the
Caudron.</p>

<p>The crucial moment had arrived. Don
Hale’s heart was throbbing fast again; his
lips were compressed; his eyes flashing.
Then, without a second’s indecision—without
a thought of the consequences—he, in turn,
began a headlong swoop through space.</p>

<p>In a moment or two he shut off the motor;
for he was about to execute that evolution
taught in the acrobatic school at Pau known
as the “Russian Mountain.” Although he
had performed it many times under different
circumstances, the terrific downward rush
never failed to make him gasp for breath. It
was the same on this occasion, and his ears
seemed to be almost bursting. The rushing
wind beat fiercely against him, its whistling
notes, ominous and threatening, ringing out
loudly. Like a plummet dropped from the
clouds, he still plunged in a vertical descent.
Now he dashed past, dangerously close to
some of the fighting machines, and through
an air filled with tracer and flaming bullets.</p>

<p>By this time the Caudron was desperately
trying to avoid the enemy in the rear. But
it seemed impossible that it could escape from
the marvelously swift and brilliantly maneuvered
German plane. This machine had just
succeeded in gaining an advantageous position
when Don Hale swept by.</p>

<p>Now he pushed the control stick away from
him, which, raising the ailerons, caused the
machine, with startling abruptness, to end its
fall and come out on an even keel.</p>

<p>Though jarred and dizzy, the combat pilot
lost not a second in starting the engine. Another
movement with the control lever, and
the Nieuport was shooting upward directly
toward the tail of the German plane. Its
pilot was already busily engaged in pouring a
hail of bullets in the direction of the Caudron.</p>

<p>Don had gone through some thrilling experiences
in the war zone, but there had
been nothing like this. He realized that the
fates had decreed that through his efforts
alone the safety of the photographic machine
depended. Never before had he fired a
Vickers gun in actual combat, and for the
briefest interval of time an overwhelming
sense of agitation—of excitement gained a
hold upon him; and before it had passed, and
while the perspiration stood out on his face,
he took aim, operating the gun with his left
hand, and fired.</p>

<p>He could hear the spitefully-crackling reports;
he saw the bursts of smoke spreading
outward and upward. Then his machine
swept past, in an ascending flight, at a distance
of not more than fifty yards.</p>

<p>It was a strange sensation to be gazing upon
an enemy’s machine so close at hand, and, in
his instantaneous glance, the details seemed
to be indelibly impressed upon his mind.
He saw the helmeted pilot turn; and for the
fraction of a second the two gazed into each
other’s faces.</p>

<p>Before Don Hale could maneuver his plane,
in order to renew the attack, he passed through
some instants of terrible suspense.</p>

<p>Had his shots taken effect? Or was the
photographic machine doomed, after all?</p>

<p>But what the boy saw when he looked
again made him feel like uttering a shout
of joy. The machine with the black crosses
on its wings was descending abruptly, with
erratic movements.</p>

<p>“I got him!” breathed the boy.</p>

<p>Triumphant, with his fighting blood aroused
to the highest pitch, the young combat pilot,
yielding to the now irresistible call of battle,
shot toward another <span class='it'>avion de chasse</span> which
bore the enemy’s markings. He had not
gone very far, however, when he was startled
by a fusillade of flaming bullets, passing close
to his wings on the right.</p>

<p>A German pilot had stolen upon him from
the rear, and Don was in the worst possible
position to defend himself.</p>

<p>Instantly he sent the nose of the Nieuport
upward, gave the control lever a swift jerk
forth and back, and, like a flash, the machine
described a complete backward somersault,
while its pursuer shot past beneath.</p>

<p>The almost breathless Don Hale realized
that his escape had been of the narrowest sort—that
he was still in the gravest peril. Other
machines were speeding toward him. The
odds were entirely too great for an inexperienced
combat pilot. Moreover, he had caught
a glimpse of three new French planes coming
to the rescue. Don’s own safety lay in the
clouds just above, and he flew toward them
with all the speed of which his Nieuport was
capable.</p>

<p>And in that upward journey, brief though
it was, he sensed rather than saw that the air
close about him was filled with fiercely contesting
planes, darting, swirling, almost tumbling
over one another. The atmosphere, too,
was literally criss-crossed by the multitude of
faint bluish lines left by tracer bullets.</p>

<p>When the clouds closed about Don Hale
and he found the view completely obscured,
he experienced a wonderful sensation of relief.
Yet his nerves were pretty badly
shaken. Like the game hunter who has
momentarily escaped the lion’s claws yet
knows that the mighty animal is lurking
near to renew the attack, his thoughts of
what the immediate future might have in
store for him sent renewed tremors through
his frame.</p>

<p>War is a cruel and pitiless thing, in which
compassion and the kindlier impulses of the
human heart have no place. He himself
could give no quarter, nor could he expect any.</p>

<p>And now there was something else besides
the relentless foe which began to cause him
anxiety—even alarm. The weather conditions
had been becoming steadily worse, and
the force of the wind, still blowing steadily
into “Germany,” made the movements of the
Nieuport like that of a boat wallowing in the
trough of a heavy sea. Sometimes, without
an instant’s warning, he found himself dropping
like a shot, and the next moment, as
though raised on the crest of a mighty billow,
sent shooting upward.</p>

<p>The clouds were growing thicker; the
curious, half luminous light was being replaced
by a deep and forbidding gloom, not
like that of night or of anything else he had
ever seen. And through this weird and seemingly
unnatural darkness there occasionally
came gleams of spectral bluish light which
told him that the greatest artillery in the
world was rapidly getting ready for action,
and that before long it might be expected to
break loose in all its majestic power.</p>

<p>Where was he?—far over the German territory?
He could not tell; yet it seemed very
likely that such was the case. At any rate,
he must make for home. How?—below the
clouds? No. There are limits to which one’s
nerves can be subjected. He must climb
through them and fly above. Single-handed
it would not do to face those lying in wait
below. He felt terribly alone—terribly friendless.</p>

<p>The darkness was suddenly torn asunder
by a brighter flash and, for the first time, he
heard a sullen rumble, which, beginning like
the roll of muffled drums, rapidly increased
until it was sounding in a crashing crescendo.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! This is about the worst
ever!” muttered Don. “Yes, I certainly
shall have something to talk about—only, it
will be too much! I never expected that I’d
be witnessing a storm from a balcony seat.”</p>

<p>He tried to impart a little jocularity to his
tone, but the attempt was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>It was a pretty awesome thing to be amid
the storm-clouds, with the coppery colored
and bluish gleams now playing almost constantly
about him; and this singular situation
conjured up all sorts of strange fancies.</p>

<p>Now the wind was buffeting the Nieuport
wildly about, tearing against the fuselage and
planes in heavy gusts.</p>

<p>But at last Don Hale’s heart was gladdened
by the sight of a circular patch of misty light;
and presently shooting through a ragged opening
in the clouds he saw the illumination
spreading out on every side and caught a
glimpse of blue in the great expanse above.
Probably the most inspiring thing he had
ever seen, it lifted a load from his mind. As
the shadows produced a depressing effect, so
the light seemed to radiate optimism and
cheer.</p>

<p>Presently the flying Nieuport carried him
to another world equally as strange as the one
through which he had just passed. Just below
him, to the limits of vision, there extended,
like a soft and moving blanket, the
billowing forms of the wind-swept clouds.</p>

<p>And skimming across their surface was the
grotesquely-shaped shadow of the speeding
aeroplane.</p>

<p>Then it suddenly occurred to Don that his
situation wasn’t so very much improved after
all. During the mêlée and his subsequent
experiences he had totally lost track of his
bearings. In which direction was the aviation
camp? That was a question he could not
begin to answer. One thing alone cheered
him—he was, at least, headed for the French
lines.</p>

<p>And while debating in his mind how soon
he might dare to make a plunge through the
vapor he happened to glance behind him.
And that single glance was the means of causing
him to make a discovery—a discovery
that was so startling, so terrifying that the
blood seemed to almost freeze in his veins.</p>

<p>Bearing down upon him, and almost within
firing range, were two great Albatross
planes—both of a scarlet hue.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt about it—they belonged
to Captain Baron Von Richtofen’s Red
Squadron of Death.</p>

<h1 id='chXVI'>CHAPTER XVI—THE EMPTY HOUSE</h1>

<p>During the afternoon of the same day that
Don Hale was destined to have his great adventures
George Glenn and Bobby Dunlap,
off duty, decided to take a little jaunt about
the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Leaving the main highway the boys struck
off toward the southeast.</p>

<p>The road sometimes took them past stuccoed
walls, gray, chipped and broken by the
ravages of time; and here and there, rising
high above the faded red coping, were the tall
and graceful poplars so characteristic of the
landscapes. Once in a while, the two, their
youthful curiosity aroused, peeped between
the bars of the entrance gates to get a look, if
they could, at the mansion so secluded from
public gaze.</p>

<p>Presently the boys were descending a steep
road which led down to a little village at the
base. Occasionally, between the trees, they
caught glimpses of red-roofed houses, and the
spire of an ancient church, all serenely beautiful
in the midst of a peaceful landscape.</p>

<p>Now George and Bobby came across <span class='it'>poilus</span>
resting on either side of the highway. And
then, to bring the grimness of warfare once
more to their minds, a Red Cross ambulance,
leaving behind it a long trail of yellowish
dust, rumbled up the hill, carrying its load of
wounded to the base hospital further to the
rear.</p>

<p>Arriving at the bottom of the incline the
two found themselves on a road which turned
abruptly. Soldiers were billeted in the village;
and in the courtyards and out on the
streets were rolling kitchens, while parked at
various points they saw huge camions awaiting
their turn to carry supplies toward the
front. Evidently but few of the inhabitants
remained; and the reason was at once apparent—there
was scarcely a house which did not
show some evidence of scorching shell fire or
the devastation caused by bombs dropped
from the air.</p>

<p>George and Bobby soon passed the quaint
old church, no longer a place of worship but a
hospital, and continued on, soon leaving behind
them the village, with its soldiers,
camions and other paraphernalia of war.</p>

<p>“Now let’s take a rest,” suggested Bobby,
at length.</p>

<p>“You’ll not hear any objections from me,”
said George. He turned his gaze toward the
east, adding: “I hope to goodness Don doesn’t
run into trouble over the front to-day.”</p>

<p>“I’m with you there, Georgie,” said Peur
Jamais, gravely. “I never saw such impolite
fellows as those Boches. Just the other
day one of them chased me for miles, and all
I did was to empty a belt of cartridges in his
direction. Honestly, I believe he wanted to
hurt me.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re about right,” laughed
George.</p>

<p>“Hello! just cast your eyes along the road.
But do it gently, though, so as not to hurt
them. Do you see that chap yonder—about
to cross?”</p>

<p>“My vision being extremely good, I can.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see anything familiar about him?”</p>

<p>George, after taking a long and earnest
look at the blue bloused figure, nodded his
head.</p>

<p>“Yes; to be sure. It’s the peasant who’s
been visiting our escadrille.”</p>

<p>“Correct, old chap. And say, did you ever
notice how chummy he’s gotten to be with
Jason Hamlin? Funny combination, that—a
college highbrow and an humble, downtrodden
tiller of the soil. By the way, Vicky
Gilbert certainly has said some funny things
to Jasy.”</p>

<p>“Have you found out yet what the scrap is
all about?”</p>

<p>Peur Jamais pondered an instant before
replying, and then said, slowly:</p>

<p>“From what Vicky said it looks as if he
thought Hamlin was, or rather wasn’t—— No,
that he was, I should say——” And
here the young combat pilot broke off abruptly,
to further remark, after a few moments
of earnest reflection: “No—I reckon I’d better
wait until further developments. One
day I happened to say a few words to one of
the chaps about it when along waltzed the
captain, who had overheard; and he said to
me: ‘What do you mean?’ Crickets! It
was awful!” Bobby began to grin broadly.
“It reminded me of the time I used to get
hauled up in the principal’s room to explain
certain things that had happened in the classroom.
But, I say; let’s skip after the old
boy, and interview him.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good?” asked George.</p>

<p>“None at all. But what’s the good of
staying here? Coming?”</p>

<p>“First tell me what the captain said.”</p>

<p>“‘No!—a thousand times no!’ as the persecuted
heroine in the play has it. Later on—perhaps.
Just now my sole desire in life is
to inflict some of my French upon the humble
plodder.”</p>

<p>Without further ado, Peur Jamais started
off and George, with a good-humored smile,
followed.</p>

<p>It took the boys but a few moments to
reach the road where the peasant had been
observed; but although he had been walking
very slowly the man was not in sight. The
road was as deserted as a road could be.</p>

<p>“Hello! That’s rather odd!” cried Peur
Jamais. “A shabby way to treat a couple
of would-be interviewers, I call it. In classic
language, I wonder where he’s at!”</p>

<p>“That oughtn’t to be a hard job for Sherlock
Holmes the Second to find out,” suggested
George.</p>

<p>Bobby laughed and began studying the
surroundings with keen attention.</p>

<p>In the fields were growing crops, all bathed
in bright, clear sunshine. Little clumps of
trees and patches of woods dotted the landscape,
while, far off, the irregular contour of
the hills limned itself with hazy indistinctness
against the brilliant sky. To the left a
touch of blue, like a bold splash of paint upon
canvas, indicated a pond, and nearer at hand
rose three sturdy oaks, majestic specimens of
their kind. Just behind these Peur Jamais
espied a house.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder a bit if that’s the
peasant’s castle,” he remarked. “Suppose
we journey over there, Georgie, and see! I
declare! I won’t be satisfied until I learn a
bit more about him. It’s a little odd that
such an uncouth specimen should take so
much interest in an aviation camp.”</p>

<p>“Mild adventures, after our strenuous ones,
have a sort of appeal to me,” confessed
George. “So I’m quite willing.”</p>

<p>Following the road for a short distance the
boys found a narrow path leading across the
field; so they headed for the ancient oaks and
the house behind them.</p>

<p>They had expected to see some evidences of
farming, some indications of laborers in the
fields beyond, but on arriving at the structure,
a typical old farmhouse, everything wore
a mournful and deserted air, as though all
human activity and endeavor had long ago
departed, leaving the building to crumble and
decay.</p>

<p>“It seems that we’ve had all our pleasure
for nothing,” grumbled Peur Jamais. “Nobody
can be living in this old shack. But as
a deserted house is anybody’s home, I’m going
in.”</p>

<p>“I’ll share the danger with you,” laughed
George.</p>

<p>The door stood invitingly ajar, and one
vigorous push sent it creaking back on a pair
of rusty hinges.</p>

<p>All the dreary and forlorn appearance
which marked the exterior of the ancient
farmhouse was to be met with in the interior.
Dust lay thick on the floors, and a few pieces
of broken-down furniture added their quota to
the depressing atmosphere.</p>

<p>“This place is enough to give a fellow the
creeps!” declared Bobby. “Just imagine
how nice it would be strolling around here on
a stormy midnight, with lightning the only
illumination. Hello!—goodness gracious!”</p>

<p>A very unexpected interruption had caused
Peur Jamais to utter the exclamation.</p>

<p>Quick footsteps had sounded. And, as both
boys, a little startled, but more surprised,
hastily glanced at an open doorway leading to
another room, they saw a blue-bloused figure
suddenly appear.</p>

<p>It was the peasant for whom they had been
seeking.</p>

<h1 id='chXVII'>CHAPTER XVII—A MYSTERY</h1>

<p>At another place and under different circumstances
this meeting would have been a
most ordinary and commonplace event, but,
somehow, in the shadowed and deserted farmhouse
it seemed to have imparted to it a curiously
dramatic effect.</p>

<p>It was Peur Jamais who broke a rather
intense and awkward silence.</p>

<p>“Hello! You are here after all!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Ah! So it is some of my young friends, the
aviateurs Americaines!” exclaimed the peasant.
His manner was that of a man who had
been startled by an unlooked-for intrusion,
and, in consequence, felt considerably displeased.
“In France, mes amis, before entering
a dwelling one usually knocks.”</p>

<p>“So we do when we enter a dwelling,” said
Peur Jamais, airily. “But what in the
world are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“And, may I inquire, what in the world
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“We came to see you.”</p>

<p>“You came to see me! How did you get
here?”</p>

<p>Thereupon George Glenn, who had a more
fluent command of French than Bobby, smilingly
explained.</p>

<p>“But, you must remember, people cannot
go everywhere they please without knowing
that they have the right,” said the peasant,
chidingly.</p>

<p>“Well, since we’re here we’re here,” said
Peur Jamais. “However, Monsieur, you certainly
can’t be staying in a place like this?”</p>

<p>“I believe I have not as yet given any information
as to my place of residence.” The
Frenchman’s tone clearly conveyed a hint
that he was annoyed at the curiosity which
Bobby displayed. “Houses are like men,
mon ami: they live their allotted time, and
then their days are done.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on, Georgie, let us take a look
at the old place,” cried Peur Jamais.</p>

<p>And Bobby, with a merry laugh, started
for the adjoining room.</p>

<p>But his passage was unexpectedly blocked.</p>

<div class='imgcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-224.jpg' alt='' id='illus-224'/>
<p class='caption'>His passage was unexpectedly blocked</p>
</div>

<p>The peasant had stepped in front of him,
saying in a firm tone:</p>

<p>“Must I remind you, my young friend, of
what I said just a few moments ago?”</p>

<p>Bobby was surprised—so much surprised,
indeed, that for an instant he stared at the
peasant without speaking; and his scrutiny
was so searching, so earnest, that the man, as
though finding it either annoying or disconcerting,
moved toward a shadowy corner of
the room.</p>

<p>“But what have you got to say about it?”
blurted out Peur Jamais, at length. “It
isn’t your house; so I’d like to know why we
mayn’t go up-stairs?”</p>

<p>“Like good soldiers, we must sometimes
obey commands without knowing the reasons
for their being given,” said the peasant,
gravely. “So I am sure you will consider
me neither impolite nor unobliging if I
refrain from speaking further on the subject.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Monsieur,” put in George,
quickly. “We have no wish to intrude.
Come on, Bobby.”</p>

<p>Peur Jamais, however, his face wearing
a rather curious expression, began to interrogate
the Frenchman, beginning with this
rather unusual question:</p>

<p>“What’s the best time to plant potatoes?”</p>

<p>The peasant smiled genially.</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of starting a farm?”
he queried.</p>

<p>“No; I am merely a seeker after information.”</p>

<p>“Then I would advise you to buy a copy of
some agricultural paper which treats such
questions exhaustively. And now, if you will
pardon me, I will say <span class='it'>au revoir</span>!”</p>

<p>“No objections, I’m sure!” grumbled
Bobby. “I hope your farm prospers. It’s
quite a hard life, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“That depends upon a man’s health,
strength and temperament,” countered the
peasant, in an unruffled tone. “Goodbye!”</p>

<p>He laid just enough emphasis on the last
words to cause the boys to nod and then walk
slowly outside.</p>

<p>They had progressed but a few yards when
Bobby began to laugh and chuckle in a most
peculiar manner. Then his face suddenly became
grave and stern.</p>

<p>“Georgie, I think I’ve made a discovery—quite
an astonishing discovery, too,” he exclaimed.
“That man is as much a peasant as
either you or I. He’s merely a bit of human
camouflage; he’s masquerading—do you get
me?—masquerading! And what’s the answer?”</p>

<p>Peur Jamais’ brow was knit. His hands
were clenched.</p>

<p>“I am willing to admit that just now he
did not either speak or act exactly like a peasant,”
said George.</p>

<p>“You’ve said something, Georgie,” declared
Bobby, very earnestly. “Listen!” As they
walked slowly, side by side, he gripped George
Glenn’s arm. “Ever since that night old
Père Goubain talked to us about spies I’ve
been keeping my eyes and ears open. Well,
do you want to know what I think the answer
is?—that mysterious peasant is a spy—yes
sir, a confounded spy. Why has he been
nosing around the aviation camp? Why
didn’t he want us to go up-stairs? Oh yes,
it’s all as clear as day. Who knows—it may
even have been he who was the means of sending
those bombing machines to spill a little
fireworks on the camp!”</p>

<p>By this time the two had reached the road,
and Bobby stopped and leaned against the
fence.</p>

<p>“It strikes me that this hasn’t been such a
mild adventure, after all,” he continued, with
increasing vehemence. “And through it we
may be the means of ridding France of a dangerous
enemy; just think of it—you and I,
Georgie! I can almost hear the commander
saying: ‘My brave and loyal friends, in the
name of my countrymen, I thank you!’”</p>

<p>“Can you also see the medals pinned to our
manly breasts?” asked the other, quizzically.</p>

<p>“I’m not joking, Georgie.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’re not. You look just as
earnest as if Captain Von Richtofen and his
red planes had come over to pay us their respects.”</p>

<p>Peur Jamais sniffed.</p>

<p>“At any rate it isn’t going to be a laughing
matter for some one,” he asserted, grimly.
“Pretty smart old chap, that! ‘Buy a copy
of some agricultural paper,’ eh! No doubt
he’s chuckling now at the way he pulled off
those evasive answers. But evasions don’t go
with court martials.”</p>

<p>“You are certainly correct there,” acquiesced
his companion.</p>

<p>“By George, Georgie, you’re an aggravating
chap!” exploded Bobby. “By the way you
act one might think that this great discovery
was of no more importance than reading an
agricultural paper. Wake up! You’re right
here on earth, and not up among the clouds!”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to do a little discreet thinking
before indulging in any indiscreet remarks,”
said George. “You know, as Longfellow
says: ‘Things are not always what they
seem.’”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare! Indiscreet talking, indeed!”
almost shouted Peur Jamais. “I suppose
your idea is to let the old bird alone,
eh?”</p>

<p>“As yet, I haven’t a very clear idea of
what my idea on the subject is,” returned
George, with a smile.</p>

<p>“And I have such a clear idea of what my
idea is that it fairly dazzles me. Great Julius
Cæsar!——”</p>

<p>Peur Jarnais blurted out this exclamation
with considerable force, and as he certainly
could have neither seen nor heard
anything to justify its utterance George very
naturally demanded an explanation.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing that would be likely to
interest you,” returned Bobby, sarcastically.
“Some rather odd thoughts about Jason
Hamlin just happened to pop into my mind.”
And then, as though ruminating to himself,
he added: “Oh, yes, I’m mighty glad we
took this walk. It may have an astonishing
sequel.”</p>

<p>George pressed him for an explanation, but
Bobby merely replied:</p>

<p>“One of these days you’ll find out.”</p>

<p>“But just think of all the suspense I’ll
have to endure,” said George, lightly.</p>

<p>Thereupon the march was resumed.</p>

<p>And notwithstanding the fact that both
boys were in the uniform of the flying corps
they were occasionally obliged by the ever-vigilant
sentries to show their credentials.</p>

<p>It was after one of these experiences that
Bobby thoughtfully remarked:</p>

<p>“I can’t understand how, with all their
care, that old would-be peasant was able to
pull off the trick.”</p>

<p>“What trick?” asked George, innocently.</p>

<p>“Trying to kid me, eh?” jeered Peur
Jarnais. “But I’m the original kid that
can’t be kidded.”</p>

<p>Toward late afternoon, seeing that a storm
was approaching, the two took counsel and
decided that it might be better to retrace their
steps.</p>

<p>“I prefer my shower baths taken in the
regular way,” remarked Bobby. “By the
looks of it, I should say the weather is going
from bad to worse.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll have to move quickly if we expect
to escape it,” commented the other.</p>

<p>During the entire trip George had many
times felt twinges of anxiety in regard to his
chum Don Hale, which he found quite impossible
to cast aside. Acting as an escort over a
hostile territory was a very dangerous thing
for a new pilot to undertake. He could recall
many men who had failed to return from
such journeys, some of whom were probably
languishing in a German detention camp.</p>

<p>Quite a number of the Lafayette Escadrille
were at the villa when the boys arrived. But
George Glenn found that he was unable to
join in the general fun and jollity.</p>

<p>The storm was very severe indeed; and
during its height George, unable to bear the
suspense any longer, went to the telephone
and called up the bureau on the aviation
grounds.</p>

<p>“Hello! Is Don Hale there?” he asked.</p>

<p>A pang shot through him as the answer
came back:</p>

<p>“No; neither he nor Albert returned with
the rest of the escort.”</p>

<p>“Did not return with the rest of the escort!”
gasped George. He felt a peculiar
dryness come into his throat and into his
heart a sinking feeling. “Were the escorting
machines attacked?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; there was a lively scrimmage.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! This is terrible!” murmured
George. Then, speaking into the transmitter
again, he asked, weakly: “Have you
no news of them at all?”</p>

<p>“None whatever,” came the response. “We
have telephoned to the observation post at
the front, but they can tell us nothing. Hale,
however, has been given credit for preventing
the destruction of the Caudron machine.”</p>

<p>By this time several others were crowding
around. All had become accustomed to
tragic happenings and the occasional disappearance
of some of their members; yet every
fresh event of the kind brought with it the
same distressing pangs.</p>

<p>“This is bad news, indeed!” exclaimed
Victor Gilbert. “Poor Don Hale! Poor
Albert! I wonder—I do wonder what could
have happened to them!”</p>

<p>“I hope it will not be the official communique
that tells us,” said George, gloomily, as
he replaced the telephone on the hook.</p>

<h1 id='chXVIII'>CHAPTER XVIII—THE RED SQUADRON</h1>

<p>When Don Hale saw the red planes of Captain
Baron Von Richtofen behind him he
certainly received the shock of his life. The
oncoming storm, the sense of solitude and
the great expanse above the clouds had all
lulled him into a sense of security.</p>

<p>A moment’s indecision nearly finished his
career as a combat pilot. Streams of bullets
were flashing past, and one of them, crashing
through the little curved wind shield in front
of his head, brought him to a realization that
only the quickest possible action could save
his life.</p>

<p>He did then what many a flying fighter
had done before him. A quick movement of
the control lever dipped the rear ailerons,
sending the plane almost vertically downward
toward the earth. With the engine stopped,
he tipped to one side, and the machine entered
the vrille, or spinning nose dive.</p>

<p>With frightful velocity, turning on its axis,
the Nieuport dove through the agitated storm-clouds.
The wind roared past him as it had
never roared before, singing and moaning,
like the strains of some wild, weird symphony
as it beat against the plane’s wires and supports.
Gasping for breath, almost dazed by
the fearful whirling motion, the boy, nevertheless,
felt the joy of triumph surging within
him. He had cheated the birds of ill-omen
of their prey. He could laugh at their efforts.
They would never catch him now that he
knew of their presence in the sky.</p>

<p>Down, down shot the little biplane through
an obscurity so dense that nothing could be
seen in any direction. And soon, while still
surrounded by the heavy vapors, it straightened
out parallel to the earth, and, shaken
and rocked by the wind, sailed swiftly
ahead.</p>

<p>But at that instant, just as all danger seemed
to be passed, Don Hale made another most
alarming discovery—something had happened
to his motor, and though he strove with the
utmost desperation to get it started it persistently
refused to work.</p>

<p>“Tough luck!” he burst out, aloud. “This
is the worst ever! Here I am miles over
German territory.”</p>

<p>Filled with apprehension, with all sorts of
dreadful fancies running through his mind,
and the dread and uncertainty of it all making
his nerves tremble and twitch, the young
combat pilot volplaned through the clouds.</p>

<p>Presently he skimmed through the thinner
mists, and saw the darkened and sombre-looking
earth beneath him. His head was
still aching from the effects of the headlong
plunge. His breath, too, came in short and
painful gasps. But all these physical manifestations
were almost unnoticed in the pilot’s
excited state of mind.</p>

<p>Was there nothing that he could do to avert
the fate for which he seemed destined?</p>

<p>There must be. Surely his career as a combat
pilot was not going to come to such an inglorious
end!</p>

<p>Feverishly—energetically, Don Hale continued
to manipulate the levers that controlled
his motor. But there was no sign of it
awakening into life. And all the while he
was gliding nearer and nearer the earth.</p>

<p>Now the vague, indefinite blurs of color were
becoming definite forms and shapes, and the
meaningless patches of light and dark houses
and trees.</p>

<p>Sick at heart, feeling that everything was
lost, with the direst fear of an impending
tragedy uppermost in his mind, the boy at
length sat back in his seat, and, for the first
time, paid close attention to the ground that
seemed to be rapidly rising to meet him.</p>

<p>He had concluded that in the all-pervading
gloom the Germans had not discovered his
presence, but almost immediately the anti-aircraft
batteries got into action and the surrounding
air became suddenly filled with exploding
shrapnel shells.</p>

<p>Now he could hear their viciously-sounding
detonations, and the steady crackling of the
guns which had sent them aloft.</p>

<p>Though faint and weak, the instinct of
self-preservation asserted itself, enabling him
to turn the machine this way and that, in an
effort to dodge the hail of missiles. The
Nieuport was wildly careening from side to
side or dropping short distances at lightning
speed; and, to add to his dismay, streams of
“flaming onions,” like rockets of a greenish
hue, darted toward the helpless airplane,
sparkling brightly in the darkened atmosphere.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the terrible reality of the situation,
it seemed to Don that he was going
through some strange, weird dream. Dumbly,
he wondered how soon the end would come.
Only a miracle, it seemed, had saved him
thus far. He could not expect such good-fortune
to continue. He seemed to stand on
the dividing line between life and eternity.</p>

<p>And when a strange, inexplicable calmness
had taken possession of him and he felt resigned
to the impending fate, the resounding
din of the batteries below and the ear-splitting,
appalling detonations of the shells suddenly
ceased, and he was gliding through the smoke-filled
air as unmolested as though on his own
side of the line.</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>The explanation was simple. The Germans
below had at last realized the truth. They
were merely waiting for the machine to drop
into their midst. It was a galling thought.
Not three hundred feet below he could see
them. And that picture of men gathering
together in groups, of men running and gesticulating,
made a curious impression upon his
overwrought brain.</p>

<p>Many a time he had heard the boys jocosely
referring to the words “Kamerad, kamerad,”
and for the first time he was in a position to
realize fully what that cry must have meant
to some of those who uttered it. And after
the glorious, boundless freedom of the air—of
the vast spaces—how could he stand the
horrors of a detention camp, where men,
penned in like sheep, were guarded and fed
almost as if they were so many captured animals!</p>

<p>Now he was one hundred feet nearer the
earth—one hundred feet nearer the clutch of
his enemies—and, with the smoothness of
a toboggan, the machine was still gliding
downward. Yes, the journey would soon be
over! He began to think of what the boys of
the escadrille would say. In his mind he
pictured them sitting around the supper table,
speculating as to his unhappy fate.</p>

<p>How strange—how remarkable it seemed to
be right there among the enemy! Still held
in the grip of an unnatural calmness, he gazed
indifferently at those gray-clad figures whose
upturned eyes were fastened upon the descending
machine.</p>

<p>Now only seventy-five feet separated him
from the ground. He would be glad when all
was over.</p>

<p>“There won’t even be any chance to set fire
to the machine,” he groaned, aloud. “The
Germans will capture it intact. And who
knows to what use the crafty Boches may
put it! But they’ll hear no ‘Kamerad,
kamerad!’ from me.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a revulsion of feeling swept over
the boy. The sight of the Germans crowding
around seemed to fill him with an anger he
could not repress. He gritted his teeth and
clenched his fists in impotent wrath. And
with this fierce rebellion against the cruel fate
that awaited him his thoughts flashed back
to Captain Baron Von Richtofen and his scarlet
planes. How little he had thought when
hearing about them in the Café Rochambeau
that that selfsame Squadron of Death was
destined to play a part in his own career!</p>

<p>For hardly a moment had Don ceased his
efforts to get the engine running, and though
it seemed useless—a futile task—he renewed
them once again. And just as he was about
concluding that nothing remained to be done
but make a landing on a field toward which
he had been heading, his ears caught a sound
which fairly electrified him.</p>

<p>“At last!” he gasped.</p>

<p>With a preliminary cough, one of the cylinders
of the motor started to work. Could it
actually be possible?</p>

<p>A fierce, wild hope, painful in its intensity,
seized upon Don Hale. It was an agonizing
moment—a moment in which he suffered all
the torture of a mind agitated by the most
violent conflict between hope and fear.</p>

<p>And while the combat pilot was vaguely
wondering if he had received just another
cruel stab the old familiar, deafening roar,
with startling abruptness, began to resound.</p>

<p>Uttering a shrill whoop of joy, Don Hale
sent the Nieuport upward.</p>

<p>No music composed by the world’s greatest
masters could have sounded more sweet to
him than the steady reverberations of the engine.
It still seemed unbelievable—something
that could not be. All the joys of a
man who, having given up hope, is unexpectedly
granted a reprieve were his, as the
airplane buffeted its way against the teeth of
the ever-freshening wind.</p>

<p>The disappointed Germans immediately
sprang to the attack, and the little Nieuport
was running the gauntlet of rifle and revolver
fire. Fast as it flew, the bullets sped faster,
and though the combat pilot could not hear
their wicked hum and zip he knew that
leaden missiles were flashing all about him,
for several holes again appeared in the upper
plane.</p>

<p>“Can I make it! Can I make it!” he kept
repeating.</p>

<p>Sometimes that wild race against such
heavy odds seemed hopeless. He dared not
rise too high, for that would give the antiaircraft
gunners a chance of bringing him
crashing down to the earth. True it was,
that many of the infantrymen seemed so
paralyzed with astonishment at the sight of a
wildly-speeding Nieuport right over their
heads as to forget to fire.</p>

<p>As moment succeeded moment, and Don
Hale remained unscathed, he peered cautiously
over the side of the cockpit. Now he was flying
above a little village fairly swarming with
the troops of the Kaiser. He could see the
heavy camions rumbling through the streets
and all the sights typical of military operations
which he had observed on the opposite side
of the trenches.</p>

<p>The thumping of his heart having in a
measure subsided, and the chilling tremors
almost disappeared, he found this flying over
the enemy’s country, in spite of the bullets
that continually sped toward him, a strangely
fascinating game.</p>

<p>The little village was presently left far to
the rear, and the speeding plane was again
over the open country, with its whitish roads
and green fields dotted here and there with
farms and houses.</p>

<p>All at once he saw something in the distance
which caused him to turn his plane in a
northwesterly direction. It was a faintish,
elongated yellowish spot suggestive of a giant
caterpillar, lying close to the ground.</p>

<p>“A balloon—an observation balloon which
has just been pulled down!” cried Don Hale
to himself. “I’ll get a closer look at it.
Great Scott!”</p>

<p>From some totally unexpected quarter he
was once again being fired at, and a sharp
metallic ring told him that some portion of
his engine had been struck by one of the
marksmen below.</p>

<p>Once more he passed through an instant of
overwhelming anxiety.</p>

<p>But the steady droning roar of the powerful
engine brought cheer to his heart.</p>

<p>“No—no; not yet!” he muttered. “I still
have a chance to cheat the Boches.”</p>

<p>The thrilling adventures and narrow escapes
through which Don Hale had passed
instead of lessening his courage and determination
had increased them, though he fully
realized how strangely the elements of chance
had favored him. That sharp ping of the
bullet striking the engine acted on his nature
like a spark applied to gunpowder, arousing
all his combativeness.</p>

<p>As the plane neared the giant observation
balloon a sudden and daring idea flashed into
the young combat pilot’s mind, and then,
almost for the first time, he thought of the
part he had played in preventing the destruction
of the photographic machine. Why
couldn’t he add another feat to his credit?</p>

<p>“By George, I’ll make a good try!” he
cried, his pulse beginning to tingle anew.</p>

<p>The Nieuport was now almost upon the
huge, unwieldy monster, and Don could
plainly see the details on its smooth and shining
surface.</p>

<p>The balloon, anchored to a heavy motor
tractor, swayed gently from side to side as the
cable to which it was attached was drawn
down by a windlass. Dozens of men, too,
were aiding in its descent by pulling on
smaller ropes.</p>

<p>A touch on the control stick sent the
Nieuport climbing upward. Then, precisely
at the proper moment, Don Hale put an end
to the ascending flight, and turning the nose
of the machine downward, he shut off the engine
and dove straight for the great gas bag.</p>

<p>He had a vision of soldiers scattering in
every direction—and they ran like men who
were seized with all the mad and unreasoning
panic of animals fleeing before a forest fire.
There was something ludicrous—almost
absurd—in the picture they made which, even
in that intensely dramatic moment, involuntarily
brought a half smile to the face of the
stern, grim-visaged boy in the pilot’s seat.</p>

<p>Don Hale knew that he was running a
most appalling risk—indeed tempting fate in
a way he had never done before, and staking
his life upon his ability to make a success of
his daring venture.</p>

<p>The instant for action had come. His machine
was pointed directly toward the slick,
rounded surface of the balloon.</p>

<p>It made a most alluring target.</p>

<p>Don pushed a button, and by this action
fired the eight rockets fastened to the sides of
the fuselage.</p>

<p>Instantly there came a resounding, awesome
roar, and eight fiery trails, each headed
by a brilliant greenish light, were flashing
toward the balloon.</p>

<p>Before the pilot could come out of his dive
several of the rockets pierced the silken envelope,
and from as many points there came
vivid bursts of flame—the days of usefulness
of that particular “sausage” were certainly
over.</p>

<p>Elation was in Don Hale’s heart. And
then, just as he redressed<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> the machine, he
caught a quick glimpse of a mighty burst of
flame, which, enveloping the balloon from
end to end, rose in ruddy viciously-curling
and leaping tongues high in the air. In a
moment the Nieuport had passed far beyond.</p>

<p>Casting a look over his shoulder Don
saw an extraordinary spectacle—masses of
flaming gas swept off by the breeze and illuminating
the surrounding gloom.</p>

<p>Triumphant—proud indeed, the boy decided
to take no more risks, but make straight
for the aviation ground, and, if good fortune
still held sway, perhaps reach it before the
rapidly gathering storm had burst in all its
fury.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the whirl of excitement,
the young pilot had vaguely impressed upon
his mind the disturbing truth that the lightning
was steadily growing brighter—the reverberations
of thunder heavier. To handle
the Nieuport successfully in the wind and
rain he knew would be a most difficult task.</p>

<p>The boy began to feel, now, the inevitable reaction.</p>

<p>He was seized with a consuming anxiety to
be away from the midst of danger. But the
rushing currents of air being dead against
the Nieuport it seemed to be just crawling
along.</p>

<p>For the first time the pilot dared to rise
higher. He was passing over one of those
desolate stretches which told most eloquently
of the terrible conflicts which had taken
place. Everywhere great shell-holes, in places
overlapping one another, pitted the earth, and
the bottoms of many were partly filled with
muddy water left by recent rains. Of all the
desolate, depressing sights which the eyes of
man could look upon this seemed one of the
worst. It was as though a blight had descended
upon the earth, to wither and destroy
everything which lay in its sinister path. Not
a village—not a house remained; all were in
crumbling ruins. Even the streets themselves
could not be traced; and of the trees
and patches of woods there remained but
grotesque, gaunt trunks, entirely stripped of
branches and leaves.</p>

<p>Of course this was not a new sight to the
boy, and, under the circumstances, he paid
but little attention to it. Thoughts of the
trenches over which he must pass, and of the
flying “Archies” the plane would be sure to
encounter were in his mind. He must ascend
still higher.</p>

<p>“This has been a trip, sure enough!” muttered
Don. “But if I get through safely I’ll
never regret it. To-day, I feel that I have
done my bit for the Allied cause.”</p>

<p>Continually, he glanced in all directions.
Vigilance was the price of life. Many an airman
had been stealthily approached from
behind and brought down without ever knowing
what had struck him, and in the gloomy
shadows cast by the heavy storm-clouds it was
doubly necessary to search the heavens for
every sign of the foe.</p>

<p>But, in spite of all the pilot’s extreme care,
he was destined to make presently another
discovery—a discovery which once more set
the blood throbbing in his temples. It was
the sudden appearance, at about his own altitude,
of another of Captain Baron Von Richtofen’s
planes. It had approached
dangerously near, too, before he was aware of its
presence.</p>

<p>It took Don Hale an instant to recover his
wits. One moment he had seemed to be alone
in the vast expanse, and in the next he was
confronted by one of the scarlet enemy.</p>

<p>With lightning velocity the Boche bore
down upon the Nieuport, and before Don
Hale could make a move to alter his course
luminous bullets were cutting a fiery trail
through the gloom about him.</p>

<h1 id='chXIX'>CHAPTER XIX—THE PERILOUS GAME</h1>

<p>At times, when the gravest dangers
threaten, the human faculties, in some mysterious
way, gain a strength and mastery which
completely banish terror. Such was the case
with Don Hale. As quickly as it was humanly
possible to do so, he turned his plane
so that the engine was between him and the
showers of bullets. Then, obeying the injunction
that self-preservation is the first law
of nature, he set the Vickers machine gun
into action.</p>

<p>And thus began a terrible duel in the air
just beneath the tossing edges of heavy and
turbulent masses of vapor. It seemed almost
certain that one of the machines must be
quickly sent crashing and hurtling downward.</p>

<p>The German pilot was evidently a master
of his machine, and his evolutions were
performed with the greatest brilliancy. Don
Hale had a confused vision of a scarlet object
flashing around, above and below him
with inconceivable rapidity. And he himself,
in order to avoid the enemy, was obliged to
execute the most thrilling and daring maneuvers.</p>

<p>And at every favorable opportunity the
wicked crackling of the machine guns rang
out. Each pilot was fighting with that desperation
which characterizes a hunted animal,
brought to bay. To Don Hale it seemed more
like some thrilling, wonderful sport than an
actual combat in which defeat might mean
the end of all things earthly. Scores of tracer-bullets,
leaving for an instant their long, thin
trails of smoke, sped by him whichever way
he turned, some passing close to his seat between
the planes.</p>

<p>The fight was so fast and furiously contested
that Don felt sure it must come to a
speedy termination. Every instant he expected
to see the bullets from his Vickers put
an end to the battling career of that lone
member of Captain Baron Von Richtofen’s
Red Squadron of Death. Yet, extraordinary
as it seemed, the enemy plane continued to
flash and circle about him with dazzling
speed,—so fast indeed that only a confused
and blurred vision of its movements was registered
on Don Hale’s brain. Waves of dizziness
swept over him; his face was smarting
and stinging from the terrific rush of air,
while a touch of air-sickness, a malady which
sometimes affects even seasoned flyers, was beginning
to threaten him.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding, he managed to keep
a firm grip upon all his faculties. One instant
of panic—one instant of relaxation he
knew would be enough to bring this strange
air duel to a dramatic and tragic conclusion.
His main effort was to keep zigzagging behind
the enemy’s tail, and thus make him waste
his bullets on the empty air.</p>

<p>In this he was not always successful. Often
he found himself facing the sinister-looking
scarlet Albatross, to get instantaneous glimpses
of its hooded pilot glaring toward him.</p>

<p>And even in those terrible moments, when
the machines threatened to crash into one another,
Don Hale could not help thinking what
an amazing thing it was that he and this man,
whom he had never met, whom he had nothing
against, and who, equally, had nothing
against him, should be fighting desperately,
with all the ferocity of maddened tigers.</p>

<p>The combat, which seemed to be long-drawn-out
but which in reality occupied only
a very short time, was brought to an end by
Don Hale. As the German plane, momentarily
occupying an advantageous position,
dove toward him, firing as it came, the combat
pilot of the Lafayette Escadrille performed an
evolution known as the renversement. He
sent the Nieuport with meteor-like swiftness
upward, and, while making a partial loop, flying
head downward, the red Albatross flashed
beneath him.</p>

<p>Still defying the laws of gravity, Don Hale
straightened the course of his plane, so that it
was flying horizontally in a direction exactly
opposite to its line of flight at the beginning
of the evolution. He then cut off the motor
and operated the ailerons at the sides of the
planes, which caused the machine to turn over
sideways in a semicircle, and thus bring it
back to a natural position.</p>

<p>The renversement was made with such
remarkable swiftness that before the red Albatross
could swing around to renew the attack
Don was shooting in an upward drive straight
for the shelter of the clouds.</p>

<p>Almost like a bullet from a machine gun
he entered the lower strata and continued to
climb, safe at last from the enemy who had
sought to destroy him. But the lightning
glared brighter than ever; the thunder rolled
more ominously. He felt sure that only a
short distance away the rain was falling in
torrents.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, the boy’s brain was in a
whirl, but a feeling of thankfulness that after
encountering so many perils he had escaped
unscathed predominated.</p>

<p>Finally emerging from the murky darkness
into the light above, Don, scanning the heavens
with the most earnest attention, could see
no signs of other planes.</p>

<p>“Well, I have had all the adventures I wish
for one day!” he soliloquized. “Whew! It
was certainly a series of nightmares! Now
I’ll just stay up here, wait until the storm is
over, and after that beat it so fast for the airdrome
that a marmite wouldn’t stand any
chance in the race. How wonderful it is to
be up here in this bright sunshine! It seems
as though I must have drifted into the
arctic regions by mistake. This is certainly
great!”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a singular scene upon which
the combat pilot gazed. The upper surfaces
of the ever-rolling and tossing clouds, of the
purest and most dazzling white, like a vast
field of snow and ice, stretched off to the limits
of vision. It seemed like a glimpse of another
world—a world of wonderful and impressive
solitude. Not a sign of life could be
seen in all that great circle. There was nothing
to link one’s thoughts with the world below.</p>

<p>As before, Don saw the shadow of the wind-buffeted
plane fantastically skimming over the
crests of vapor. Very soon vivid lightning
was flashing from cloud to cloud and the rolling,
booming reverberations of thunder were
beginning to fill the upper region with solemn
and awe-inspiring volumes of sound.</p>

<p>Don felt that he must rise still higher.
Every gleam filled him with a strange foreboding;
it seemed as though, no matter which
way he traveled, there was no possibility of
escaping the gravest danger. The pilot was
having difficulty, too, in navigating the Nieuport
in the sweeping gusts of wind. Sometimes
it was carried rapidly aloft like a chip
on a rising wave, to drop, a moment later, with
a suddenness that almost took away his
breath.</p>

<p>His altimeter began to register an increasing
height, and at length the boy, in an icy
region, was looking down upon far-off masses
of clouds.</p>

<p>If the young combat pilot of the Lafayette
Escadrille had not been so intensely lonely or
so worn out with excitement and fatigue, he
would positively have enjoyed the strange and
unique experience. But now he most ardently
hoped that the fury of the tempest
would soon abate.</p>

<p>Over what part of the country was he?
Perhaps he had gone miles and miles out of
his course. There was no way to tell.</p>

<p>And what if anything should happen to
his engine, as it had done before?</p>

<p>Now and again his thoughts involuntarily
became fixed upon such an eventuality,
causing, anew, chilling tremors to sweep through
his frame. As important, now, as the beating
of his heart were the pulsations of the motor.
It filled him with a sense of awe, and his
keenly-listening ears were attuned to catch
the slightest change in the never-ceasing roar
of the engine.</p>

<p>“By this time the boys must think I’m a
goner,” he communed to himself, aloud.
“Poor George Glenn! I’ll bet no one dreams
that I’m away up here, condemned to sail
around in great circles until warring nature
gets over its tempestuous fury. And, oh boy,
but it’s cold! Even with these heavy gloves,
my hands are becoming numb. I’m beginning
to realize now just how an icicle feels.
I don’t know where I am, but I certainly wish
I were somewhere else!”</p>

<p>Time began to drag out interminably.
Anxiously, he kept glancing down upon that
glorious, shimmering, white expanse in the
hope that he might discover signs of the
clouds beginning to break away—of some
little ragged opening through which he might
get a glimpse of the earth. But it always
presented the same monotonous expanse.</p>

<p>“Not yet! Not yet!” he sighed.</p>

<p>Like a rider driving a fractious steed, he
was obliged to pay the closest attention to the
navigation of the speedy Nieuport; and as the
unruly horse may sometimes take the bit in
its mouth, defying the will of its master, so
the airplane, aided and abetted by the gale
of wind, often gave him cause for the greatest
anxiety.</p>

<p>Between the blue heaven above and white
clouds below, he kept on flying in great
circles, having in his ears the never-ceasing
reverberations
of the rolling and booming
thunder. Would it never end! How long
was he condemned to remain so high aloft?</p>

<p>The sun, at length, was descending in the
west and before very long must disappear behind
the distant masses of vapor. More than
once Don considered tempting fate by a
descent through the clouds, and each time the
peril deterred him. How would it be possible
for the Nieuport to live amidst such a raging
storm!</p>

<p>“No, no! I can’t risk it,” muttered Don.
“By George! Was a human being ever
placed in such a position before? Just now I
can’t say that I want to enjoy the caressing
touches of those wind-blown clouds on my
cheek.”</p>

<p>Bravely, the boy tried to divert his mind,
but the physical discomforts, besides the increasing
sense of being out of the world, made
it quite impossible. The storm had now
reached its height. Forked tongues of lightning
were flashing incessantly in the clouds,
illuminating the interior of their swiftly-flying
masses with a weird and spectral bluish
glare.</p>

<p>“Not yet! Not yet!” sighed Don, again.
“Great Scott! I can’t stay up here forever.
This is certainly a case where a fellow needs a
friend. Hello! Something besides clouds
and blue sky at last!”</p>

<p>Far below, just tiny specks, the pilot had
observed a flock of birds, skimming close to
the ragged, tossing edges of vapor—so close,
indeed, that at times they became lost to view
as it closed about them.</p>

<p>That sight was, indeed, a grateful one to
the lone occupant of the upper air. He
turned his machine to watch them, until at
length they grew faint in the distance, then
became lost to sight, leaving him to feel more
alone than ever.</p>

<p>As the sun crept still lower toward the
horizon, the effects began to change; the
arctic whiteness was being replaced by softer
and more mellow tints; delicate purplish
shadows filled the hollows of the clouds, and
the deep blue of the sky above was slowly
fading. The scene constantly grew more
wonderful and impressive. The rays of the
great coppery-colored ball, at last partly submerged
in the clouds, were tipping the masses
of flying vapor with an orange glow. Sometimes
their varying forms suggested mountain
peaks or stretches of rolling hills; sometimes
the keenly imaginative Don Hale could see in
them suggestions of fairy-like cities, with
minarets sparkling like spots of golden
flame.</p>

<p>The knowledge that the day was coming
to a close made him more and more eager to
begin his homeward journey. But, with a
persistency that was exasperating—alarming—the
storm continued to expend its fury.
Still there was not a rift—not a sign to give
him either cheer or hope.</p>

<p>And now a new worry—a new apprehension—began
to attack him; the gasoline was giving
out. He could not hope to keep up his flight
much longer. The thought made the blood
fairly pound in his temples.</p>

<p>Thrilling as all his adventures had been,
was fate going to crown them all with one infinitely
more thrilling—infinitely more dangerous?</p>

<p>The combat pilot shuddered as he pondered
over the situation. Captain Baron Von Richtofen’s
dreaded Squadron of Death seemed
indeed puny and insignificant when compared
with the tremendous forces of nature which
he must eventually face.</p>

<p>A short reprieve from the terrible danger
remained. He could not yet bring himself to
make that great plunge—a plunge where all
the elements of chance were dead against him—where
he could expect no mercy—where no
human power save his own could be availing.</p>

<p>Five minutes passed; then ten. He dared
not delay much longer. With a tense and
drawn face, Don Hale again peered over the
side of the cockpit in an effort to discover
some point where the storm had spent its
force.</p>

<p>There was none.</p>

<p>“It’s as bad as staking one’s life on the flip
of a coin,” he groaned. “Well, here goes!”</p>

<p>The boy firmly pursed his lips, operated
the ailerons by means of the control lever,
and, next instant, the plane was speeding
downward. He could see the golden lights
and purple shadows apparently flashing up to
meet him; he could feel the plane, in the
grip of the stronger currents of air, shivering
and trembling.</p>

<p>And then a saying of the French pilots
came into his mind: “The plane fell like a
dead leaf to the ground.” Was his Nieuport,
too, destined to “fall like a dead leaf to the
ground”?</p>

<p>That question must soon be answered.</p>

<p>For one brief instant he pulled up the machine.
During that interval of time, short as
it was, he had a terrifying vision of a quivering,
glimmering light which filled the whole
surrounding air. The appalling boom and
crash of thunder overwhelmed the sound of
the motor. He seemed to be sailing just
above some frightful inferno resembling nothing
he had ever before encountered.</p>

<p>With a sinking feeling at his heart and a
muttered: “Now!” the pilot once more
turned the nose of his machine downward.</p>

<p>The dreaded plunge was made.</p>

<p>In a second’s time he had left the gold and
purple of the upper world and was immersed
in the storm-clouds. As though dipped in an
icy bath, he felt cold chills running through
him and running through him again. Flash
after flash of lightning, blinding in its bluish
glare, momentarily tore asunder the darkness,
and he had instantaneous glimpses of phantom-like
masses of vapor and portions of the
moisture-laden machine gleaming with a
sharp, metallic light.</p>

<p>Electricity seemed to be forming all about
him. He could not rid himself of a terrible
fear that the machine might get into the path
of one of those zigzag streaks of flame chasing
each other in every direction. The thunder
was cracking like pistol shots multiplied
a thousand fold. It came, too, in wild, gurgling
notes, or in mighty, deafening detonations
that dazed and bewildered the pilot.</p>

<p>In the anguish of his soul, he cried out, not
once but many times:</p>

<p>“I am lost! I am lost!”</p>

<p>And so it really seemed; for the bravely-battling
plane, almost shaken to pieces by the
onrushing wind, was driven first one way and
then another, or beaten back, threatening at
every instant to topple over on its back and
complete the rest of its journey in an uncontrollable
spinning dive.</p>

<p>Don Hale was fairly gasping for breath.
Every bone in his body ached. His brain
was dizzy and reeling. But that powerful
instinct of self-preservation implanted in
every one prevented him from giving up in
utter despair, though he fully expected that
the airy caverns of the clouds would be the last
thing his eyes were ever destined to look
upon.</p>

<p>With teeth gritted together, he fought on,
matching his wits and brains with the seething,
shrieking vortex that toyed with the
plane and seemed bent upon his destruction.
And each hard-won victory brought a little
more hope to his heart and lessened the strain
on his overwrought nerves. Yet it all
appeared unreal, unnatural and unearthly—like
a chaos—nature itself in the grip of anarchy.</p>

<p>But how thick were the clouds? He could
not understand why he should be so long immersed
in their humid depths.</p>

<p>However, when torrents of rain presently
began thudding and splashing against him he
realized that he must be approaching the
lower surfaces. How earnestly he longed for
the moment to come! Each blinding glare
of lightning, each mighty peal of thunder
still had a terrifying effect. He could not rid
himself of an awful dread that the fates
would, at last, decide against him.</p>

<p>Thus, when the Nieuport actually staggered
through the last strata, the boy almost felt as
if it was something scarcely to be believed.
He could not realize that the most terrible
part of the voyage was over and that as he
had cheated the Germans in their prey so had
he cheated the Storm King.</p>

<p>But dangers were not yet ended. All
around him extended a curious expanse almost
as obscure, almost as gloomy and murky as
that through which he had just passed. And
where was he to land? In what direction lay
the encampment of the Lafayette Escadrille?
Don was even in doubt as to whether he had
gone beyond that devastated strip of
territory—“No Man’s Land.”</p>

<p>“I reckon there’s nothing to do but trust
to blind luck,” he murmured to himself.
“Ah, old earth—good old earth—I never appreciated
you so much before!”</p>

<p>Down, still further down glided the Nieuport,
while the boy strove to pierce the enshrouding
darkness.</p>

<p>At last the very faintest of blurs brought
an exclamation of joy to his lips. But as the
utmost caution was necessary in approaching
the earth, he began to volplane at an angle
less steep. It would be the easiest thing in
the world, he knew, to smash the biplane in
landing, and thus bring disaster at the journey’s
end.</p>

<p>But still everything was too indistinguishable,
too hidden by the rain and shadows for
him to gain any idea of the nature of the terrain.
All he could make out were faint and
mottled grayish patches merging insensibly
into one another.</p>

<p>A decision must soon be made. The gasoline
was running dangerously low.</p>

<p>Still nearer the earth, like a storm-tossed
gull, the Nieuport descended.</p>

<p>It was only a few hundred feet in the air
when Don Hale made a discovery that brought
a hoarse cry from his lips.</p>

<p>He had seen the faintest possible gleams of
ruddy color tingeing the gray gloom to the
west.</p>

<p>What was that light? What did it mean?</p>

<p>With joy surging through his heart, Don
Hale thought he knew the answer. The light
came from flares, lighted on the aviation
grounds, to act as a beacon of safety to belated
airmen.</p>

<p>“As sure as I live, that’s what it must be!”
he cried. “But——” A sudden doubt entered
his mind. “Does it come from ‘Germany’ or France?”</p>

<p>The boy felt, however, that to hesitate any
longer would be foolhardy in the extreme.
He guided his plane toward the faint light,
watching it slowly growing stronger with an
inexpressible feeling of thankfulness and relief.</p>

<p>Very soon he could faintly trace the lines
of a gigantic letter T, formed by a number of
fiercely-blazing fires.</p>

<p>There could be no further doubt; it was
certainly an aviation field.</p>

<p>Only the knowledge that he must keep all
his faculties alert in order to guide the plane
prevented the pilot from uttering a series of
jubilant shouts.</p>

<p>Now the blazing flares were becoming clear
and distinct. He could make out the tongues
of flame, and the illumination spreading out
on all sides, to cast a faint, delicate glow for a
short distance on the water-soaked ground.
Then he began to detect the presence of human
beings gathered in little knots or running in
the direction of the plane.</p>

<p>Steadying his overtaxed nerves, Don Hale
skilfully maneuvered his plane, with the rain
and the wind still beating fiercely against
him.</p>

<p>A bright flash of lightning—the brightest
he had seen since leaving the clouds—suddenly
bathed the earth in its vivid glare.
And that swift transition from almost the
darkness of night to the brilliancy of noonday
brought peace of mind to the young combat
pilot of the Lafayette Escadrille. What cared
he now for Captain Baron Von Richtofen and
his Red Squadron of Death or the loud and
angry rumbling of his other enemy—the
Storm King! For there, right below him,
were the familiar hangars, the familiar
fields—the headquarters of the escadrille itself.</p>

<p>And, only fifty feet above the ground, he
could hear, above the wind, which still played
its wild symphony on the wires of the machine,
the welcoming shouts and hurrahs of
his fellow pilots of the squadron.</p>

<p>Twenty-five feet—then ten! And presently
the rubber-tired wheels jarred against the
ground, and the Nieuport, traveling a short
distance, was brought to a stop by the gusts
of wind that bore down upon it.</p>

<p>And that had no sooner happened than
Don Hale, the happiest boy in the world, was
lifted out of the machine by his loudly
felicitating and joyous friends.</p>

<p>The perilous game had been played and won.</p>

<h1 id='chXX'>CHAPTER XX—HAMLIN</h1>

<p>Don Hale was certainly given a tremendous
reception; and a short time later, while
comfortably seated in a chair at the villa
recounting his memorable adventures, was
highly gratified to hear T. Singleton Albert
verify his statement concerning the destruction
of the observation balloon.</p>

<p>“This is the way it came about,” explained
Drugstore: “During that scrimmage with
the Boches I happened to see Don’s machine,
hotly pursued, enter the clouds. And Don
being rather new at the game, I thought I’d
try to hang around a bit, so as to keep an eye
on him if I could.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” cried Don. “Albert,
you’re a brick!”</p>

<p>“I had a pretty fierce time of it, too, with
tracer bullets cutting holes through the air all
about me, but, after a while, I managed to
slip away from the attacking planes. By that
time the scrap was over and the photographic
machine and its escort were on their way
home.</p>

<p>“Somehow or other, I don’t know why, I
had a pretty strong suspicion, Don, that your
Nieuport wasn’t among them. So, instead of
making for the airdrome, I flew back over the
lines, incidentally saying ‘how-do-you-do’ to
a number of ‘Archies’ and a bushel or two of
‘onions.’ I shot up pretty high to avoid being
shot up myself, and after traveling quite
a considerable distance began cutting big
spirals in the air. The clouds were looking
mighty ominous and threatening, and several
times yours truly was tempted to beat it, but,
fortunately, something restrained me.</p>

<p>“My Nieuport was away up near the ceiling
when, on looking down, I suddenly discovered
a plane which appeared exactly as
though it was crawling along the ground.
Through a pair of binoculars I could see the
circles of red, white and blue on the wing tips.
Then I volplaned a bit, hoping to make out
whether it was your machine or not.” Albert
began to laugh. “Yes, I saw the whole shooting
match, Don; and the way that big sausage
began to blaze after your little interview certainly
tickled my fancy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, boy, but wouldn’t I have enjoyed the
sight!” giggled Bobby Dunlap.</p>

<p>“Of course it wasn’t possible for me to tell
whether it was your plane or not, Don, but
after seeing the Nieuport begin to climb to a
higher altitude I concluded to say good-bye to
‘Germany’ and streak for the home plate.</p>

<p>“Very soon it began to rain—rain like the
dickens, too, and before I got within miles of
the airdrome my bus was doing everything
but turning somersaults. Anyway, Don,
you’ve got a witness to prove that you turned
the trick.”</p>

<p>“That’s simply great!” chuckled Don.
“Some afternoon, eh?”</p>

<p>“You bet!” agreed Drugstore. “But it certainly
was a jolly rude jolt to me when I got
back and found that after all you had not returned.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, he’ll have something to talk
about for the rest of his life,” said George
Glenn.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt about that,” laughed
Don.</p>

<p>The young pilot had by no means recovered
from the effects of his turbulent experiences.
Some of the dizziness still remained. His
nerves occasionally twitched and he experienced
a feeling of physical exhaustion, all the
more unpleasant because of his boyish fear
that the others might observe it.</p>

<p>It had required a considerable effort for
him to tell his story, and a still greater to
enter into the general conversation.</p>

<p>Finally the thunder began to roll less frequently;
the storm was breaking away.</p>

<p>Soon afterward one of the mechanics stepped
into the room to inform Don that his machine
had been found full of holes.</p>

<p>“Just a little bit more, and it would have
made a capital piece of mosquito netting,
Monsieur l’Aviateur,” he declared.</p>

<p>“If I should happen to see any mosquitoes
around here so big that they couldn’t get
through such holes I’d sure take that next
train for home,” guffawed Bobby Dunlap.</p>

<p>“And if I’d had a piece of mosquito netting
manufactured for me by German bullets, I
wouldn’t even wait for the train; I’d start
running,” laughed the mechanic. He turned
to Don.</p>

<p>“It’s a great wonder to me, Monsieur, that
your nose and ears weren’t clipped off.”</p>

<p>“I expected more than that to happen,” returned
Don, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>At length Bobby Dunlap began to tell the
hero of the afternoon about the mysterious
peasant.</p>

<p>“He’s a German spy, sure as shooting,” he
whispered. “But don’t say anything to the
boys about it, Donny. George Glenn promised
me he wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why not explain the matter to the lieutenant?”
asked Don, quite breathlessly.</p>

<p>Peur Jamais reflected an instant, then shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I intended to at first,” he declared, “but,
thinking it over, concluded to wait until I
could arrest the old bird myself and march
him over here at the point of a pistol. And,
oh boy, that is going to make a bigger sensation
than your cooking the big sausage.”</p>

<p>“But he may slip away,” suggested Don.</p>

<p>“That idea struck me, too,” commented
Peur Jamais, in a troubled tone. “But”—he
brightened up—“it will only mean that
somebody else is going to do the point-of-the-pistol
act. Wouldn’t it make a dandy movie
drama, eh? And, just to think, Donny, if it
hadn’t been for old Père Goubain I might
never have known what was going on.”
Bobby laughed joyously. “Crickets! I can
hardly wait for the fireworks to begin.”</p>

<p>In the interest aroused by the story of the
mysterious peasant, Don almost forgot his
fatigue. He could not remember ever having
enjoyed a supper more than he did that evening;
and the sense of security and freedom
from all danger as they sat around after the
meal proved most pleasant and welcome.</p>

<p>On the following day Don Hale was in his
Nieuport again, and performed the usual two
patrols of two hours each over the lines without
meeting with adventures.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed, and it was a time
filled with enough narrow escapes and thrilling
incidents to last even an aviator a lifetime.</p>

<p>At length Don Hale’s day off arrived. Late
in the afternoon he seated himself comfortably
by the window and spent the time in reading
a book and occasionally joining in the conversation
about him. The irrepressible Bobby
Dunlap was in the room, as was also Jason
Hamlin.</p>

<p>Finally the latter rose to his feet and began
walking toward the door, whereupon Bobby
blurted out:</p>

<p>“I say, Jasy, have you seen the old peasant
lately?”</p>

<p>Hamlin, who was one of those individuals
who apparently dislike the slightest familiarity,
frowned, remarking briefly:</p>

<p>“Yes; just the other day.”</p>

<p>“I must say, this particular specimen is
rather a dull looking old chap until one gets
to talking to him. Ever been over to his
place, Hammy?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Jason.</p>

<p>“So have I,” laughed Peur Jamais. “And
there’s everything there but what a farm
ought to have. He must be using some
method of growing vegetables by wireless.
By the way, Jason, ever go through that old
ramshackle house?”</p>

<p>“Only the first floor,” responded the other,
adding abruptly: “Bobby, several times I’ve
overheard you making mysterious observations
in regard to that particular ‘specimen,’
who is a rather dull looking old chap until
one gets to talking to him. How would you
like to offer an explanation?”</p>

<p>Bobby’s expression swiftly changed. The
laughing light left his eyes, and, for an instant,
he looked not only surprised but displeased.</p>

<p>“So you were in the house?” he cried.
“Well, what did you find?”</p>

<p>“That the peasant was not altogether what
he seemed. I heard you also mention Sherlock
Holmes, which would naturally suggest
that you thought of doing a little investigating.
How about it?”</p>

<p>Bobby scowled quite fiercely.</p>

<p>“Really, Jasy, I’m quite surprised at you,”
he declared. “Did you learn how to eavesdrop
in a correspondence school or did it just
come naturally?”</p>

<p>“One doesn’t have to eavesdrop when you’re
around, Bobby,” returned Hamlin. “You
don’t know how to whisper.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, frightfully,” growled Bobby.</p>

<p>“Some people have ears so keen that they can
even hear what isn’t intended for them. Run
outside and play. When I want to tell you
anything about the old peasant you’ll get it
first hand. And as I notice you seem to appreciate
his company so much I won’t be impolite
enough to make any disparaging remarks
about him.”</p>

<p>“Some people’s eyes are so sharp they can
even see what isn’t intended for them,”
laughed Hamlin. “However, I won’t avail
myself of your kind permission to run out
and play, but will take a walk instead.”</p>

<p>“Where?” asked Bobby.</p>

<p>“It’s a secret, but I’ll tell you. I’m going
in the direction of my destination. So-long,
Messieurs. I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>And, with a half mocking laugh and a
wave of his hand, Hamlin disappeared outside.</p>

<p>“I declare, that chap’s about the limit!”
exclaimed Peur Jamais to Don Hale. He
lowered his voice. “You noticed, Donny,
that he didn’t want to tell us where he is going.
I wonder if——” Bobby paused, looked
thoughtfully out of the window, scratched the
back of his head, then resumed: “Yes, I’ll
bet that’s just it!”</p>

<p>“What is?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“That Jasy’s going over to see the old boy
now. Say, Don, put up that book, and see
how near my deduction comes to the truth.”</p>

<p>“Which means, I suppose, that you’re going
over there yourself?” asked Don.</p>

<p>“You guessed it the first time. Coming?”</p>

<p>“Having aroused my curiosity so much
about the mysterious peasant, I think I will,”
responded Don. “It adds a touch of activity
to a day otherwise full of perfect repose.”</p>

<h1 id='chXXI'>CHAPTER XXI—THE ARREST</h1>

<p>The cheerful glow was fading from the sky
when Don and Bobby Dunlap started out in
quest of mild adventure.</p>

<p>The boys walked leisurely—in fact so leisurely
that when Don Hale had his first
glimpse of the three majestic oaks which concealed
the old farmhouse from view, Venus,
the evening star, was making its sparkling
presence known in the bluish-gray firmament.</p>

<p>“See here, Donny,” almost whispered
Bobby, “I don’t think we ought to make this
a conventional visit. In our present capacity
as detectives I feel that we’re justified in using
any means at all to trap this old codger.
Let’s steal up and do a little spying ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Just the scheme,” approved Don.</p>

<p>The two started ahead.</p>

<p>The dreary, deserted aspect of the surroundings,
the distant booming of the guns and the
nature of the expedition all combined to produce
a tingling sensation in Don Hale’s
nerves.</p>

<p>Now they were approaching the great trees,
and the boy caught his first glimpse of the old
dilapidated dwelling. In the dim shadows of
the end of day, with a mystery hovering over
it, it assumed in his eyes a weird and sinister
appearance. The gables and chimneys were
silhouetted crisply against the translucent
tones of the ever-darkening sky. Don’s eyes
roved over the windows, each a dull and lifeless
patch of dark. Everything gave the impression
of utter desolation.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe the mysterious peasant can
be around just now,” he murmured. “And
I reckon Bobby’s idea in regard to Jason
Hamlin is altogether wrong.”</p>

<p>Skirting around the old oaks, the two
reached an open stretch. However, there
were masses of shrubbery beyond, affording
excellent places of concealment; so, after a
moment’s reflection, Don and Bobby continued
straight along, and presently found themselves
in the midst of the dense shadows not
far from the entrance to the house.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed, and Don began to
feel that such a vigil around a deserted house
had in it something of the absurd and ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Bobby——” he began.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h-h!” whispered Bobby.</p>

<p>Then silence between the two ensued.</p>

<p>And in all probability it would have remained
unbroken for some time but for the
sound of human voices suddenly coming from
the house. They were raised, as though the
speakers had become engaged in a heated
argument.</p>

<p>The watchers were fairly electrified.</p>

<p>“Aha! What did I tell you!” blurted out
Bobby, forgetting caution in his eagerness
and excitement. “I know those voices.
They belong to Hamlin and the spy.”</p>

<p>The altercation grew louder and more turbulent,
then quieted down, until, finally, the
quietude was as complete as before.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it all means!” murmured
Don. “The mystery deepens. Ah! Things
seem to be developing fast.”</p>

<p>Cautiously, he stepped over to Peur Jamais’
side. “What’s the next move in the game,
Bobby?” he inquired, sotto voce—“the point-of-the-pistol
act?”</p>

<p>“Keep still!” commanded Bobby, fiercely.
“I’m trying to hear what they have to say.
Did you catch any of the words?”</p>

<p>“Not one,” answered Don. Then, with a
muttered exclamation indicative of extreme
surprise and annoyance, he faced about,
nudged Bobby in the ribs, and exclaimed in a
low, suppressed tone: “As I live, some one is
coming along the road. It won’t do to stay
here. We’ll be seen.”</p>

<p>“And if we get around on the other side
we’ll most likely be observed by the chaps in
the house,” burst out Peur Jamais. “Who
in the world could have expected anything
like this? By George! It must be a veritable
spies’ retreat.”</p>

<p>Somewhat precipitously, Bobby began to
move around the vegetation, and Don joined
him a moment later on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Peering between the leaves, the latter could
soon make out a shadowy form approaching.
But the light was too dim for him to see
whether the man was civilian or soldier. The
boy’s interest was aroused to the highest pitch.</p>

<p>What could this man’s errand be? Evidently
he must know the mysterious peasant
and be familiar with the grounds.</p>

<p>“Curious! Curious!” muttered Don.</p>

<p>Expectantly—anxiously, he waited until
the man had passed, then began retracing his
steps, with Bobby close at his heels.</p>

<p>When he had resumed his former position,
the boy, gazing over the top of the branches
and leaves, was just in time to observe the
man disappear in the dense shadows of the
old farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Now what do you think of all this?” almost
stuttered Bobby. “Oh, boy, but I feel
kind of sorry for Jasy, though. This night’s
work may get him into a whole pile of trouble.”</p>

<p>He was evidently going to add something
more, but the sound of voices again stopped
him. They were no longer raised as if in
anger, yet, nevertheless, the conversation was
evidently being carried on with the greatest
seriousness.</p>

<p>And just about this time the two disciples
of Sherlock Holmes saw a very dim light appear
in one of the windows of the first floor,
which, flashing in an erratic fashion, rapidly
grew stronger, as though some one were bringing
a lamp into the room.</p>

<p>Very soon the last vestige of day had disappeared,
and overhead the stars and constellations
were shining and twinkling with that
wonderful brilliancy which they only possess
when viewed far from smoke-filled towns.
The boys no longer feared discovery. Night,
with all its mystery, all its weirdness and
majesty, was upon them, and though his fellow
pilot was only a few yards away Don
could no longer distinguish his form.</p>

<p>Easy in mind, therefore, they were able to
give their undivided attention to the house.
Now and again the light was blotted out, as
figures momentarily passed in front. It was
all very interesting, invoking in the mind
thoughts of plots, of mysteries and of the
machinations of spies.</p>

<p>“If we could only hear what they are saying,”
groaned Bobby.</p>

<p>“I know a way,” declared Don.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to crawl right up beneath the
window and listen.”</p>

<p>“Bravo, Donny! I’m with you there.”</p>

<p>Carefully as the two proceeded, it was impossible,
in the darkness, to avoid making
some noise; and each time both involuntarily
halted in their tracks, half expecting to hear
some one come rushing out of the house to investigate.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!”</p>

<p>The young combat pilot could not repress
this exclamation, and, at the same instant, he
heard a low whistle coming from the unseen
Bobby close at hand.</p>

<p>Both had been caused by a peculiar action
of one of the occupants of the room. Lamp
in hand, he had approached the window, and,
thrusting the feeble light outside, moved it up
and down and sideways several times.</p>

<p>Mystified—puzzled, Don Hale felt that any
further advance under the peculiar circumstances
would be entirely too risky, and he
was about to whisper this opinion to Bobby
when a very faint sound from the rear caused
him to turn quickly. A peculiar tingling
sensation shot through him. Yet he could
not quite explain the reason why. What was
it he had heard?—a footfall? Or, in the
excitement, had his imagination been tricked by
the rustling of the vegetation?</p>

<p>In the darkness and mystery of the night
the unseen often assumes in the imagination
formidable proportions, carrying with it
curious, undefinable fears.</p>

<p>And while Don Hale stood there, irresolute,
his ears distinctly caught the sound of footsteps.
Then followed a sharp, metallic click.</p>

<p>A stream of whitish light was fantastically
streaking across the ground toward the boys.</p>

<p>An involuntary exclamation escaped Don’s
lips. He felt himself almost shivering.</p>

<p>But a few paces away stood a man. And,
clearly, the electric torch which he carried
was seeking them out. What was the meaning
of it all? How had they been so unerringly
tracked?</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the brilliant white
rays; then leaving the ground they shot upward,
wavered forth and back erratically and
presently fell squarely upon his face.</p>

<p>“Make no move, Messieurs!” exclaimed a
strong, firm voice. “You are under arrest!”</p>

<p>“Under arrest!” gasped Don, literally astounded.
“Who—who are you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t—I don’t understand!” quavered
Bobby Dunlap. Rather feebly, sepulchrally
he echoed Don Hale’s query: “Who are
you?”</p>

<p>The white light suddenly described a circle
in the air, and flashed for one brief, solitary
instant, upon a silver shield. The man was
holding his coat open, thus allowing it to be
seen.</p>

<p>“What—what does this mean?” stuttered
Peur Jamais, while Don Hale, more surprised,
more nonplused than he had ever been in his
life, vainly strove to see the features of the
mysterious person before them.</p>

<p>“It means that, as a member of the French
secret service, I am carrying out my orders,”
came the astonishing rejoinder. “Let me repeat:
you are under arrest.”</p>

<p>“But why? What for?” almost exploded
Bobby, who had found his voice and nerve.
“You have made some extraordinary mistake.
Aha! Now I think I know what it
means—you’ve got the wrong people, that’s it.
Those you are seeking are in that house,—in
that house, do you understand! Quick, now,
before they get away.”</p>

<p>To further increase Bobby’s agitated and
disturbed state of mind the man uttered a
gruff laugh, following this with a loud
whistle.</p>

<p>Almost instantly, as if in answer, footsteps
sounded, and, on turning quickly, Don and
Bobby saw three men just leaving the house;
the beams from a swinging lantern carried by
the foremost now and then throwing weird
splotches of light upon their forms, one instant
bringing them out in sharp relief, the
next allowing the darkness to again gather
them in its folds.</p>

<p>“It’s all utterly beyond me,” muttered Don
Hale, as he viewed the strange little procession
approaching.</p>

<p>The man with the lantern was the mysterious
peasant. And, strangely enough, he
showed no more surprise at finding the two
American aviators so close to his door than if
such a visit were the most ordinary and commonplace
thing in the world. One of those
accompanying him was Jason Hamlin; the
other the boys had never seen before.</p>

<p>Jason Hamlin was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“And so we meet under rather peculiar
circumstances!” he remarked, harshly. “Let
me say, Peur Jamais, that——”</p>

<p>“Let me say something first,” interrupted
Bobby, savagely. “Do you know what he
tells us?”—he jerked his finger in the direction
of the man with the electric torch—“that
we are under arrest.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” exclaimed Hamlin, in a voice
which shook with suppressed anger.</p>

<p>“You, too, under arrest!” gasped Don.
“By Jove, this is certainly a weird night!”</p>

<p>“And how about that chap parading around
in a peasant’s blouse and wooden shoes?”
cried Peur Jamais. “If any one ought to be
arrested he’s the one.” He turned to the secret
service man. “I demand that you take him
into custody. He’s an impostor—a—a——”</p>

<p>“Softly—softly, my young friend,” broke
in the mysterious peasant. “I deeply regret
that an unpleasant duty had fallen to my lot,
particularly as our country has every reason
to be grateful to America.”</p>

<p>He threw open his thin blue blouse, at the
same instant raising his lantern. And as the
yellow light shone on another shield precisely
similar to the one which adorned the breast
of the other man, both Don Hale and Bobby
Dunlap gave voice to exclamations of the
greatest surprise and wonderment.</p>

<p>“So you, too, belong to the secret service!”
cried Don.</p>

<p>“Can—can you beat it!” came from Bobby,
weakly.</p>

<p>“I think it would be a rather hard job,”
broke in Jason Hamlin. “And——”</p>

<p>He was interrupted by the third man,
who had been a silent witness to the proceeding.</p>

<p>“Let me put in a word,” he exclaimed, authoritatively.
“I also belong to the secret
service; and I wish to say to you young
Americans that you are at liberty to return to
the villa—the headquarters of the Lafayette
Escadrille. Under no circumstances, however,
are you to leave it until this affair has been
entirely cleared up. I and my camarades are
not here to answer questions. Your captain
has already been notified. Remember, you
are technically prisoners. This may seem
harsh, ungrateful, and unappreciative perhaps
of the work you have done for France, but the
law knows no sentiment; it is cold and
pitiless. Now you may go.” Addressing his
compatriots, he added: “Come, Messieurs.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the three secret service men,
with words of adieu, turned toward the
house.</p>

<p>“I never was so angry, so wilted with surprise
and disgust in the whole course of my
life!” fumed Bobby Dunlap. “Not here to
answer questions, eh! Never even had the
politeness to say why we were pinched. It’s
an outrage—that’s what it is!”</p>

<p>“Prisoners, eh!” remarked Don, with a dry
laugh.</p>

<p>“And the comedy has to have still another
act!” broke in Jason Hamlin, ironically.
“You are right, Bobby: it is an outrage.
But what you mean is not exactly what I
mean.”</p>

<p>And, with this enigmatic remark, the aviator
started to make his way toward the road.
The two other “prisoners” followed.</p>

<h1 id='chXXII'>CHAPTER XXII—THE TRIAL</h1>

<p>The Hale-Hamlin-Dunlap case certainly
created a sensation among the pilots of the
Lafayette Escadrille—indeed it created a great
deal more talk than the fact that the Germans
had begun to paint their battleplanes in colors
of the most extraordinary and brilliant hue.</p>

<p>No one could understand the affair; it appeared
a most unfathomable mystery, and
especially so when the captain of the squadron
politely informed Victor Gilbert that he, too,
was technically a prisoner.</p>

<p>“Oh, chains and dungeons! I suppose, the
next thing, they’ll be arresting the whole
squadron!” cried Bobby Dunlap when apprised
of this new and singular development
in the <span class='it'>cause celebre</span>. “Goodness gracious, but
I wish that last act would begin!”</p>

<p>The patience of the “prisoners” was not to
be severely taxed, however; for, on the
following morning, they received a summons to
appear in the reception hall of the villa.</p>

<p>Entering, they found what appeared to be
a court about to open its session. Seated on
one side of a long table was the captain of the
squadron and a gray-haired military man, a
lieutenant, as was revealed by his uniform.
Opposite to them sat the secret service men,
the former “peasant” scarcely recognizable
in his civilian’s clothes. Numerous papers of
an official character were strewn about the
table, greatly heightening the appearance of a
court procedure.</p>

<p>“Messieurs,” exclaimed the military man,
looking up gravely, “kindly take seats at the
table.”</p>

<p>He looked like a stern old judge as he
spoke. His eyes were cold and hard, the
lines on his face grim and set and his closely
cropped whitish moustache revealed a mouth
indicating determination and strength of
character.</p>

<p>Bobby Dunlap as a rule was not disposed
to take things seriously, but under the present
circumstances the silence in the big room, the
frigid atmosphere, the formality and the
gravity expressed upon the faces of the military
men had its effect, making him feel ill at ease,
uncomfortable and nervous.</p>

<p>“Messieurs, we are now ready to proceed,”
announced the lieutenant at the head of the
table. “Let me affirm in the beginning that
we have no doubt of your loyalty or devotion
to the cause which you espouse. At the same
time I must explain that the military authorities
as well as the secret service officials never
allow the most trivial circumstance to pass
without the most thorough investigation. In
numerous cases everything is, of course, found
to be entirely right, but it may happen that
the hundredth will turn out otherwise, and
perhaps that which appeared futile—a waste
of time—may be revealed, under the searching
light of truth, as a dangerous intrigue of
our enemies.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, most extraordinary cases have
come to our attention,” put in the captain.</p>

<p>“We will hear Monsieur Robert Dunlap
first,” continued the officer in charge of the
proceedings. “Monsieur Dunlap, kindly
stand up.”</p>

<p>At this, Peur Jamais, whose general
appearance and manner belied the name bestowed
upon him by his friends, obeyed.</p>

<p>The interrogation began.</p>

<p>“Is it true,” asked the officer, “that on
several occasions you made use of this expression
in reference to Jason Hamlin: ‘other
games are just as dangerous’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur the Lieutenant,” gulped
Bobby, red and confused.</p>

<p>“In using that expression what did you infer?”</p>

<p>“Well, I—I—you see——” Peur Jamais,
finding his tongue getting tangled, abruptly
paused. Then, having mastered in a measure
his uncomfortable feelings, he resumed: “I
heard Monsieur Victor Gilbert make this observation,
as well as several others to Monsieur
Hamlin, all seeming to indicate——”</p>

<p>Bobby halted again; the flush on his cheek
deepened.</p>

<p>“Continuez, Monsieur,” commanded the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>“That—that he might be a German spy,”
exclaimed Bobby, desperately. “I heard so
many stories about the espionage system from
old Père Goubain, of the Café Rochambeau,
near our training camp, that perhaps I became
unduly suspicious.”</p>

<p>The man whom the boys had formerly
called the “mysterious peasant” looked up
with a smile.</p>

<p>“With Monsieur the Lieutenant’s permission,”
he exclaimed, “I will explain, though
I do not wish the fact to be generally known,
that Monsieur Goubain is affiliated with the
secret service and has given us much valuable
information.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh!” gasped Bobby, while all the
other Americans in the room uttered suppressed
exclamations.</p>

<p>“His object in speaking so freely was not
only to show you the dangers that existed but
to get you to keep your eyes open.” The man
smiled. “In one case, at least, he evidently
succeeded.”</p>

<p>“You have no evidence against Monsieur
Hamlin?” continued the lieutenant, addressing
Bobby.</p>

<p>“No, Monsieur the Lieutenant,” responded
Peur Jamais.</p>

<p>“That will do. You may sit down. Monsieur
Gilbert.”</p>

<p>When the former college student rose to his
feet he showed none of the perturbation which
had affected Bobby.</p>

<p>“Monsieur Gilbert,” began the lieutenant,
“it will be necessary for you to explain your
entire connection with this affair, which, as
our report indicates, began long before you
came to France and joined the Lafayette Escadrille.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur the Lieutenant,” returned
Gilbert. In an easy, conversational tone he
began: “Before hostilities broke out in 1914
my father and Jason Hamlin’s were firm
friends, as well as business partners. Mrs.
Hamlin was born in Germany, and her husband
himself had distant relatives living
there. The war had not continued very long
before disputes began to arise between my
father and his partner on account of the
latter’s ardent championship of the cause of
Germany.” Gilbert glanced in the direction
of Jason Hamlin. “His son, too, was equally
disposed to favor that country. And as our
fathers had heated arguments so did we.
Both of us, I may say, were at work for the
firm. Finally the differences became so acute
that after a particularly violent altercation,
Mr. Hamlin, Senior, announced his intention
of withdrawing from the firm, which he
shortly did. His son, too, went with him;
and, from the closest of friends, we became so
estranged as to be considered enemies.”</p>

<p>“After the entrance of America into the
war did the Hamlins still remain pro-German?”
queried the officer.</p>

<p>Victor Gilbert smiled.</p>

<p>“I have never had any conversation with
the Mr. Hamlin, Senior, since that time,” he
replied, “and I do not know what his opinions
are. Frankly, I must say that in regard
to the son it seemed incomprehensible to me
that one with such strong German proclivities
could so change his opinions as to come over
here and fight for the Allied cause.”</p>

<p>“May I speak?” interjected Hamlin, somewhat
heatedly.</p>

<p>“Your turn will come in a few minutes,
Monsieur,” said the presiding officer. “Continuez,
Monsieur Gilbert.”</p>

<p>“I was astounded when Hamlin came to
the aviation school. And, judging from many
things he had said, I feared that perhaps he
might actually be a spy. And in some of our
altercations—altercations that interested Monsieur
Dunlap—I intimated just as much.”</p>

<p>“You certainly did,” jeered Jason Hamlin,
with an angry glare. “And if you’d only
had sense enough to——”</p>

<p>“Silence—silence!” interrupted the lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Naturally, words may be said in the heat
of anger which would not be uttered when
cooler judgment prevails,” continued Victor,
doggedly. “Why, I ask, shouldn’t I have
been suspicious? And when I remarked to
Hamlin that ‘other games are just as dangerous’
it was meant as a warning for him to go
a bit slow.”</p>

<p>“Has your opinion been altered?” asked
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Victor Gilbert nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, Monsieur the Lieutenant,” he replied.
“And the reason is because of Hamlin’s very
excellent record since he joined the squadron.”</p>

<p>Jason Hamlin now had the opportunity to
explain his side of the case.
As he began speaking his manner was
decidedly different from that of the other two
witnesses. He was clearly angry—aggressive,
and his voice, raised high, rang through the
room.</p>

<p>“I am very willing to admit that I was
pro-German, as Monsieur Gilbert told you,”
he declared. “But, as events change so can
one’s opinions change with them. Before
America became involved in hostilities I had a
perfect right to favor Germany; but to have
done so afterward would have been disloyal—indeed
a traitorous act. No one has the right
to go against his own country. And when I
learned that Victor Gilbert had joined an
aviation school in France I determined to
show him, as well as any others who might
have doubted my patriotism, that they were
entirely mistaken. And as words without
action count for little, I decided to follow his
example and become an aviator.”</p>

<p>At this point Jason Hamlin’s stern expression
deepened. He clenched his fists; and
when he spoke again it was in even louder
tones than before.</p>

<p>“My friend Monsieur Dunlap may think
that he alone pierced the disguise of the
peasant, but, if so, he is in error; and, surmising
that I might be under suspicion, I made it a
point to cultivate the man’s acquaintance.
At last the feelings which injustice always
arouse caused me to decide that it was time to
make an end of the farce—hence my visit to
the farmhouse. I boldly told the secret
service man that I knew what was going on;
I said he could strip off his peasant’s disguise
and work to better advantage elsewhere. I
declared that I was receiving a very poor reward
for daily risking my life for the Allied
cause. We had some words, which were
brought to an end by the appearance of that
secret service man sitting there.” With a
wave of his hand, Jason Hamlin continued:
“The rights of an individual are as sacred as
the rights of the government.” He drew
himself erect. “I ask—I demand to know if
you have the slightest evidence against me?”</p>

<p>His flashing eyes, the fearlessness of his
manner, the righteous indignation expressed
in his voice brought a strong and dramatic
touch to the situation.</p>

<p>Following his words there came a silence,
curious and impressive.</p>

<p>Bobby Dunlap, fearing that in the judicial
atmosphere this outburst might bring a stern
rebuke, stared almost open-mouthed at the
lieutenant. The latter, however, showing
neither surprise nor displeasure, remarked,
calmly:</p>

<p>“We have no evidence against you, Monsieur
Hamlin. And I may say that reports
received from our agents in America are
thoroughly satisfactory. Kindly take your
seat while we listen for a few moments to
Monsieur Castel of the secret service.”</p>

<p>Smilingly, the ex-peasant stood up.</p>

<p>“It won’t take very much time,” he announced.
“I am glad indeed that everything
has terminated so satisfactorily for all concerned.
This case, I may say, was all brought
about by remarks being overheard. Sometimes
a whisper is enough to set the secret
service in action. My confreres and I immediately
began an investigation, and all of you
young Messieurs have been under surveillance
for some time.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh! Can you beat it!” muttered
Peur Jamais.</p>

<p>“Messieurs Glenn and Dunlap’s actions on
the occasion of their visit to the house were
rather peculiar, especially that of this young
Monsieur here.” He pointed to Bobby. “It
could be readily seen that his curiosity was
not merely the expression of a youthful desire
to see the house, and, when he, in the company
of Monsieur Hale, started off on their
walk yesterday afternoon they were shadowed
by my fellow detectives here. And their actions,
of course, were so suspicious—a fact
which they themselves must admit—that
there was nothing to do but place them under
arrest. While Monsieur Boulanger came into
the house to inform me that the boys were in
the garden, Monsieur Brion, who knew where
they were concealed, kept track of their movements,
and, at a signal which I gave by means
of the lamp, he brought the matter to a climax.
I believe there is nothing more for me
to add.”</p>

<p>Bobby Dunlap and Don Hale were now
called upon for an explanation, which they
gave to the entire satisfaction of those conducting
the examination.</p>

<p>At its conclusion the stern-faced lieutenant,
with a suspicion of a smile, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You have all been found not guilty, and,
in accordance with that fact, Messieurs Gilbert
and Hamlin, I sentence you to shake hands
and forget whatever differences may have existed
between you. Human nature is fallible,
and, had the case been reversed, you, Monsieur
Hamlin, would have acted in a precisely
similar manner to that of Monsieur Gilbert.
Let me take this occasion to thank and compliment
you for the noble work which you
have been doing in the cause of humanity
and justice.”</p>

<p>The two young aviators nodded, in recognition,
and each, in turn, thanked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Then, without a remaining trace of animosity,
they clasped each other’s hands.</p>

<p>And in this happy fashion ended the case
of Hamlin and the peasant, which was a nine-days’
wonder in the escadrille.</p>

<p>But, though it was ended, the conversation
about it by no means came to such an abrupt
termination. The principals came in for
many bantering remarks, and had to stand
a great deal of good-natured chaffing. Of
course Bobby Dunlap was the principal victim.</p>

<p>“I say, Peur Jamais,” laughed George, “can
you now almost hear the commander saying
‘My brave and loyal friends, in the name of
my countrymen, I thank you’?”</p>

<p>“Joke if you like,” grinned Bobby, good-naturedly.
“Anyway, I made a few truthful predictions.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I said it wasn’t going to be a laughing
matter to some one.”</p>

<p>“Correct, old chap.”</p>

<p>“And, after all, it certainly did mean an
astonishing sequel.”</p>

<p>And so speaking, Bobby chuckled mirthfully.</p>

<p>Several weeks later, in the spacious grounds
of a chateau occupied by the military authorities,
a lively and spectacular scene was being
enacted. Soldiers were drawn up in a hollow
square. And there, where danger did not
exist, could be seen all the pomp and pageantry
of warfare, so lacking in the actual
operations. The warm, clear sunshine shone on
generals’ uniforms, on military motor-cars and
on high-spirited horses, champing at their bits.</p>

<p>And besides the military there were present
a few men in civilian dress, the most prominent
among them being an extremely ponderous
man with a most beaming face whom
all the former students at the École Militaire
de Beaumont recognized as old Père Goubain,
the proprietor of the Café Rochambeau.</p>

<p>What was the occasion of all this festivity?</p>

<p>It was because a number of airmen, Red
Cross ambulance drivers and soldiers had so
distinguished themselves as to earn the gratitude
of the French Republic that they were to
be awarded the Croix de Guerre and other
decorations.</p>

<p>Among those who were recipients of the
War Cross were Don Hale and T. Singleton
Albert. It was Don Hale’s feat in saving the
Caudron photographic machine and his subsequent
destruction of the observation balloon
which had brought him the coveted honor.</p>

<p>And after a general had pinned the Croix
de Guerre to his breast and the proceedings
were over the first to shake his hand was old
Père Goubain.</p>

<p>“Ah! La France can never lose with such
young men as you enlisted in her cause,” he
exclaimed. “And now, mon ami, what are
your plans?”</p>

<p>“I hope to be transferred to the American
air service as soon as possible,” returned the
smiling Don Hale.</p>

<p>“I knew that would be the answer,” cried
old Père Goubain. “And I am very certain
that Monsieur Don Hale with the Yanks will
be as successful as he was with the Lafayette
Squadron, and make a name for himself that
will carry beyond the seas.”</p>
